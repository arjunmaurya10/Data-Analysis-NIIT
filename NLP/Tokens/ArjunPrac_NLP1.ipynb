For the first time, Cates hesitates. They\\n\\tface each other across the length of the lobby.\\n\\n\\tALGREN\\n\\n\\tStruggles down the remaining steps into the lobby.

Her body slumps to the floor.\\n\\tPolice sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an\\n\\tattempt for Algren\\'s gun.

Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth\\n\\twith both his and Cates\\' gun. Two bullets crash into the\\n\\tbooth. Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are\\n\\tominously near. Ganz finally retreats out the entrance.\\n\\n\\tSTREET\\n\\n\\tBilly and Rosalie weave their way across street to the\\n\\tCougar. They make a U-turn. Ganz runs out.

With lightning sudden quickness, he\\n\\treaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back.\\n\\tBilly smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he\\n\\tleaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol.  The big\\n\\tslugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as\\n\\tRosalie shrieks.\\n\\n\\tINT. BACK BEDROOM\\n\\n\\tGanz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off\\n\\tthe bed, pushes Sally out of the way ... opens the door and\\n\\tstarts firing furiously down the corridor...

He goes to the window...\\n\\n\\tEXT. FIRE ESCAPE\\n\\n\\tGanz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground. He stops\\n\\tfor a second... Then Cates appears, Ganz fires a shot then\\n\\tstarts to run. Cates keeps coming...\\n\\n\\tINT. FIRST BEDROOM\\n\\n\\tHammond hears the gunfire, runs out of the room...\\n\\n\\tCATES\\n\\n\\tDives down the fire escape.\\n\\n\\tBATHROOM\\n\\n\\tHammond enters to find it empty of Ganz and Cates, only Sally\\n\\tcrying hysterically ...

Ganz ducks in a doorway...\\n\\n\\tHAMMOND\\n\\n\\ton his street hears the shot... he runs toward it, down a\\n\\tnarrow alley between two buildings....\\n\\n\\tEXT. DOORWAY AT END OF ALLEY\\n\\n\\tGanz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of\\n\\tCates.  They move very close to where be is crouched... it is\\n\\tHammond coming toward him... Ganz suddenly rolls a garbage\\n\\tcan in his path, dropping him like a stone.\\n\\n\\tCATES\\n\\n\\tComes toward where he expects to find Ganz... Ganz has his\\n\\tarm around Hammond\\'s throat and his gun to his ear...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGANZ\\n\\t\\t\\tDrop it... you come up against me,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou\\'re gonna lose...\\n\\n\\tHammond drops his gun.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGANZ\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t (continuing)\\n\\t\\t\\tHey, cop, come on...l got\\n\\t\\t\\tsomething for ya... come on...\\n\\n\\tEXT.  MAIN STREET\\n\\n\\tCates comes out of the doorway from which he\\'s fired...and\\n\\tcomes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it\\n\\tdown when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy.  The hand\\n\\tthat\\'s around Hammond\\'s throat also holds the black bag.\\n\\tCates walks forward, his gun down at his side...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGANZ\\n\\t\\t\\tAfter I get outta this, cop...I\\'m\\n\\t\\t\\tgonna live forever...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCATES\\n\\t\\t\\tI don\\'t think you\\'re gonna make it.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGANZ\\n\\t\\t\\tWhaddya mean...I got your gun ...\\n\\t\\t\\tI got his money...

Hammond twists as Ganz\\n\\talso fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet\\n\\tbackward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the\\n\\tground, looks at Cates.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMMOND\\n\\t\\t\\tJesus Christ, I didn\\'t think you\\'d\\n\\t\\t\\treally do it. You are crazy.\\n\\n\\tGanz\\' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side.\\n\\tCates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again.\\n\\n\\tGanz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look\\n\\tof childish disbelief passes over his face.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGANZ\\n\\t\\t\\tI got hit.  I can\\'t believe it. I\\n\\t\\t\\tgot shot.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCATES\\n\\t\\t\\tYou\\'re done.  End of story.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGANZ\\n\\t\\t\\tI ain\\'t gonna beg for my life. It\\n\\t\\t\\tain\\'t cool.\\n\\n\\tHe runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is\\n\\tstopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his\\n\\tchest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of\\n\\tGanz\\' now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMMOND\\n\\t\\t\\tYours?\\n\\n\\tCates raises the pistol.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCATES\\n\\t\\t\\tMine...\\n\\n\\tPause.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCATES\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t (continuing)\\n\\t\\t\\tYou okay?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMMOND\\n\\t\\t\\tYeah.

       "' \"48 HRS.\" by Roger Spottiswoode and Walter Hill & Larry Gross and Steven E. De Souza FADE IN: OPEN COUNTRY - DAY Endless green hills bisected by a ribbon of highway. A road gang clearing brush by the side of the road... Twenty-five men in prison fatigues sweating through their mid-afternoon labor. THREE GUARDS Flank the working prisoners... Mountie hats, shotguns, sidearms, sunglasses; they look like they mean it. HIGHWAY A battered pickup appears...approaches. Suddenly, it coughs, shudders, stalls. A big Blackfoot Indian named BILLY BEAR gets out and starts cursing and kicking the vehicle.Then he begins walking toward the road gang... ROADSIDE BRADY is the Guard near the center of the work gang; he smiles at the oncoming man, pokes a prisoner beside him. BRADY Wonder what reservation they let him off of... The prisoner is GANZ who looks up, grins at Brady... GANZ Yeah, there goes the neighborhood. Brady laughs as Billy Bear closes in on him. BILLY Say, buddy, my engine\\'s overheating and I got 30 miles before the next station... Could I get some water out of your cooler? Ganz leans on his hoe, speaks as Billy passes... GANZ Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto. BILLY You got a real big mouth, convict. BRADY It\\'s okay, chief. He\\'s just joking... BILLY How about the water... GANZ Firewater, Tonto? Is that what you... Billy whirls, swings at Ganz. Both men roll to the ground. BRADY Hey! Jesus Christ! THE OTHER GUARDS Seeing the commotion, they run toward it. GANZ AND BILLY As they struggle, Billy slips a pistol into Ganz\\' hand. BRADY That\\'s a state prisoner, asshole...! Back off... ROADSIDE Brady pulls Billy away from Ganz just \\'as one of the other officers arrives... Ganz suddenly whips out a pistol, shoots Brady at point-blank range. Before the other Guards can even react, Billy comes out with his own pistol, caps the Second Guard. THIRD GUARD Still forty yards away... In mid-draw, be howls as a bullet from Ganz breaks the nearby ground. He fires, then turns and runs for the prison bus. GANZ Smiling, fires twice. but the range is too great for pistol work... THE OTHER PRISONERS Watching....Then they all scatter in different directions... GANZ Hefts his weapon... GANZ Come on... He and the big Indian run to the pickup, climb in and roar away. INT. BUS The THIRD GUARD making a call on the police radio... OFFICER APO 657, Unit 25 to APO 478t APO 657t Unit 25 to APO 478. RADIO RESPONSE Go ahead, Unit 25. OFFICER Escape in progress. Two officers shot off rail crossing 31. Prisoners escaping. Two men, one six-four, 200 pounds, dark, an Indian, the other, Albert Ganz, five-ten... FURTHER DOWN THE HIGHWAY Several miles from the escape... A big semi parked by the side of ttie road; back doors to the closed trailer open. A station wagon parked across the road. The pickup appears, approaches the semi, slows down and drives up the ramp into the van. Ganz and Billy jump out, shove the ramp up inside the truck and close the big doors. STATION WAGON Ganz and Billy climb inside ancl roar off, back in the direction of the road gang. BILLY BEAR Takes off his hat, puts on a baseball cap and sunglasses... BILLY Get ready to duck. Ganz dives for the floor. Three police cars go by, sirens blaring, lights flashing. They pass the road gang. Ganz reappear, smiles... GANZ You know something? I\\'m having a real good time. HIGHWAY The station wagon blasts down the pavement... Becomes a small dot on the landscape. TRANSITION. A DOORWAY - NIGHT the portal slams open revealing a man holding a huge pistol,jack cates, s.F.P.D., a large and powerful man... He stealthily moves up a stairwell. CORRIDOR He stops at the top of the stairs... Listens gun still ready. A continuous sound of running water... Cates moves toward the bathroom. Rips the door open. BATHROOM The shape behind the shower curtain freezes. Cates, gun held level, moves forward... Rips the shower curtain open. Revealing a young and very beautiful woman, ELAINE MARSHALL. CATES Inspector Jack Cates, S.F.P.D.... And you\\'re wanted. Elaine stares at him as Cates turns off the water. ELAINE What am I wanted for? CATES I don\\'t answer questions, I ask \\'em... A moment as she continues to stare at his pistol. ELAINE I don\\'t think your gun\\'s loaded... CATES This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin\\' lucky? ELAINE I still don\\'t think it\\'s loaded. Elaine shakes her head and smiles, folds her arms over her breasts, shivers a little... Cates looks at the cylinder, spins it... CATES Hey, you\\'re right. ELAINE You\\'re hopeless. CATES That\\'s the way I see it, too. Be puts the gun down on the edge of the sink, embraces her. ELAINE I\\'m all wet. CATES What\\'s wrong with that? They both smile. TRANSITION. BEDROOM Cates in bed with Elaine. She wears his shirt. ELAINE A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today. CATES What\\'d you do? ELAINE Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I\\'d just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker. CATES I guess he got the message... ELAINE Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who\\'s to say I\\'m not a dumb bitch. I work in a bar, right? I can\\'t read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do... CATES Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you\\'re the type that lets assholes decide for you. ELAINE Aren\\'t you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit? CATES I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it\\'s bullshit doesn\\'t mean I don\\'t know something about it. ELAINE If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I\\'ll take brutal indifference. CATES Hey, you know what I really think? ELAINE Tell me--I\\'m dyin\\' to hear it. CATES I think you\\'re ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I\\'ve ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em. She smiles at him after this. It looks like they\\'ll kiss. Their faces are close. Then she lightly moves back. ELAINE You oversimplify every... He stops her in the middle of the sentence by kissing her, then pulls back... CATES Some things are simple, right? Their faces are very close ... but they don\\'t touch for another second. ELAINE Right... TRANSITION. SAN FRANCISCO - DAWN Titles continue. Tugs churning across the bay... Quiet city streets. Parked cars covered with early morning dew... A newspaper truck slowly grinds by, drops a bundleand moves on. EMBARCADERO - DAWN The station wagon pulls up to a young punk, HENRY WONG, on a motorcycle. Billy Bear smiles and leans out the driver\\'s side window. BILLY You got somethin\\' for us, Henry? Henry produces some credit cards. Billy passes them to Ganz for inspection. GANZ How hot are they? HENRY Hot? Hey, they\\'re not even room temperature. Ganz snorts derisively. GANZ How ya doin\\'? HENRY Can\\'t complain. GANZ We got a lot to talk about. HENRY Yeah, old times. GANZ We\\'ll follow you. Take it slow,okay? HENRY Sure, right. Ganz pockets the credit cards as Henry wheels away. INT. STATION WAGON GANZ I want to drive awhile. BILLY I ain\\'t tired yet. INT. STATION WAGON GANZ Maybe after we get done with him I\\'m gonna buy us some girls. BILLY Whaddya mean, buy? GANZ Pros. Ganz stares at Billy. BILLY Pay money? GANZ Yeah, dummy. Money. BILLY I never paid for it in my life. GANZ It\\'s better when you pay... they let you do anything. BILLY They always let me do anything. I don\\'t want to pay for it. I never paid for it in my life. GANZ Just do what I say, okay? We\\'ll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don\\'t you trust me? Billy smiles. BILLY Sure, I trust ya. They drive off. NORTH BEACH - RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN First light breaks over Telegraph Hill. A quiet row of Victorian townhouses now converted into apartments. APARTMENT BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING Cates is sprawled across the double bed; Elaine is on the verge of falling off the edge. Cates\\' eyes snap open. A second later, his wrist watch alarm goes off. He turns it off, gets out of bed and begins pulling on his pants. Elaine sits up in bed, still wearing Cates\\' blue shirt... Cates picks up a robe as Elaine gets out of bed on the opposite side, throws the robe to Elaine... She takes off the shirt, swaps it for the robe and throws the shirt to Jack. ELAINE You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning. CATES What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place? He buttons his shirt and heads for the kitchen. KITCHEN Cates brushing his teeth at the sink, Elaine making coffee. ELAINE You know, that\\'s my toothbrush, Jack. He keeps brushing. CATES Maybe you ought to buy me one. ELAINE Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back. He stops brushing, turns and looks at her. CATES I\\'m here. And I\\'ve been coming back for quite awhile... Let\\'s not hassle, okay? And can I have a cup of coffee? Please. She pours some coffee, hands him a cup and saucer... Cates pours some whiskey into it from a flask. ELAINE That\\'s a fairly crummy way to start a morning. CATES Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead. ELAINE Maybe that makes a nice excuse. CATES Maybe you don\\'t know what the hell you\\'re talking about. Cates picks his holstered .44 off a chair back and begins strapping it on. ELAINE When you start with that attitude... it\\'s like I don\\'t know who you are. CATES What do you want to know? What difference does it make? I\\'m the guy in your bed the last three months. I make you feel good. You make me feel good. What the hell else do you want from a guy? ELAINE I wish you\\'d stop trying to make me mad so I won\\'t care for you... I wish you\\'d give me a little more of a chance. He turns away, moves into the corridor near the stairwell. CATES I don\\'t have time for this. I gotta go to work. She stands frozen... He turns back and looks at her; it\\'s hard to apologize. CATES (continuing) Look, I\\'m glad I\\'m in your life... and hell, with an ass like yours, I figure anything might be possible. She is warmed up by the first part, amused by the second; she approaches... ELAINE You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless. CATES That\\'s the way I see it, too. ELAINE Call me later. CATES You sure you want me to? ELAINE Yeah, for some reason, I\\'m sure... He moves closer, kisses her.. CATES Thanks for the coffee. ELAINE I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge... CATES Guess people ought to know who I am... He turns to go down the stairwell... ELAINE Jack, wait. Here... She puts a scarf around his neck. ELAINE (continuing) It\\'s cold as hell out these mornings, and you know what the man said, the coldest winter I ever spent was the summer I spent in San Francisco... They don\\'t kiss. He nods appreciately, the scarf in hand as he turns and goes. STREET - NORTH BEACH - MORNING Cates comes out of Elaine\\'s apartment building, crosses to his whipped and battered 64 Cadillac convertible, notices a parking ticket stuck under the windshield wiper... CATES Son of a bitch. Shoves the ticket in his coat pocket, gets into the Caddie puts the scarf around the rear view mirror, starts the engine and guns away... CITY STREET Cates driving the convertible; he comes down a hill and turns toward the East Bay... TRANSITION. GOLDEN GATE PARK - MORNING Henry Wong, seated on a park bench. Now very dead, a bullet hole in the middle of his forehead. Billy Bear is seated next to him on the bench reading the race form. GANZ Using the telephone at an outdoor booth a few feet beyond the bench. STREET - BROADWAY DISTRICT - DAY LUTHER and ROSALIE, a young couple, turn a corner. A dark parody of all-American young marrieds. They are bickering as usual. ROSALIE I liked that carpet we saw. LUTHER We can\\'t afford it. ROSALIE Don\\'t remind me. LUTHER Whaddya want me to do, go out and steal for the money? I hated the color anyway; the color sucked... Suddenly, Billy and Ganz descend on Luther and Rosalie and pull them into their station wagon.. INT. STATION WAGON Billy has Rosalie by the mouth, gagging her with his big paw... Ganz has his gun at Luther\\'s neck. GANZ Surprise, Luther. LUTHER Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up- GANZ I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid... LUTHER I don\\'t know what you\\'re talkin\\' about. GANZ You want that Indian to snap her neck? He mimes the gesture... snap... GANZ (continuing) Instead of worryin\\' about Reggie, you better worry about me... LUTHER Don\\'t give me this, we were partners. GANZ Billy, go ahead, break it... LUTHER No! Don\\'t kill her. I can get you the money. GANZ When? LUTHER I can\\'t get it until Monday. Honest. GANZ You chickenshit punk... LUTHER Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can\\'t get it till then. Monday morning, that\\'s when it opens. After that, I\\'ll get the money to you right away... Ganz finally takes the gun from the neck. GANZ I always liked you, Luther. You were always a lotta fun to hang out with... Rosalie is rubbing her neck now that she\\'s been released... Ganz gestures to Billy. GANZ (continuing) We\\'re gonna keep her. Luther desperately doesn\\'t like this. LUTHER Come on, you can trust me. Please. GANZ You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I\\'ll put holes in her you wouldn\\'t believe. He smiles at Luther, pinches him on the cheek, shoves him out of the car. LUTHER Stands shivering as it powers away. WALDEN HOTEL - DAY A small hotel on one of the quiet streets behind Union Square. A GREEN COUGAR Pulls up across the street. INT. CAR Tha car arrives in front of the hotel. GANZ Nice place, huh? Rosalie is very nervous. ROSALIE What are you gonna do to me in there? Ganz gives her a casual smile. GANZ Maybe that\\'s where I\\'m gonna cut your throat. BILLY He\\'s just kiddin\\', you just keep doin\\' what I tell ya, you\\'ll be okay. They move out of the car, head for the hotel. LOBBY A FRIZZY YOUNG BLONDE sits behind the desk in a mirrored entrance hall. She reads a lurid paperback. Morning traffic streams by outside as Ganz, Billy and Rosalie enter and approach the desk. GANZ We need some rooms for a couple of nights...Okay? She smiles at Ganz. FRIZZY Sure. We don\\'t get many real customers, ya know? Most people only stay an hour or two... Passes a form across. Ganz signs it, Frizzy glances at his signature then takes a key from the rack behind. GANZ I want her young. And tall. Nice legs. Legs are important. Then, real thin. Yeah. NO jeans-A dress? a nice summer dress. You know I want her fresh... I\\'ll tell you why, because I been hoein\\' weeds and makin\\' license plates for a couple of years... Yeah, I know you don\\'t get it... BILLY BEAR Sees a couple approaching, he shoves the dead man down on the bench and spreads the newspaper over his head. The body now looking like a typical park bum who has spent the night. Billy walks over to Ganz. BILLY Hey, what about me? GANZ And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw. Billy smiles, takes the Polaroid... POLAROID A close shot of the dead man with the bullet hole in his forehead. GANZ Takes the photograph back from Billy and slips it into his jacket pocket... GANZ Walden Hotel. Third near Broadway. Tell them to ask for ... uh... He takes the hot credit cards out of his pocket, the name embossed on the plastic.. GANZ (continuing) G.P. Polson...P.O.L.S.O.N....Just be a couple of hours. Hangs up. The two men head for a green Plymouth... TRANSITION. FRIZZY Number twenty-seven, Mr. Polson. GANZ Put them next door, okay. She gives him a slightly knowing look. FRIZZY Sure, hey, you got the whole floor to yourself... Ganz sends her back a sharp look. GANZ Keep your filthy ideas to yourself, lady. Ganz picks up his suitcase, walks over to the nearest stairwell. Billy and Rosalie follow... TRANSITION. STREET Bars starting to fill up with mid-day customers... A black Chevy cruises past and stops further up the block. Two Plainclothesmen, VANZANT and ALGREN, get out of the car. As they start toward the Walden... THE CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE Pulls up near the two men. Cates climbs out of his car and walks over to them. CATES Hey, fellas, what\\'s happening? Radio said you guys had something on... ALGREN Not much, Jack ... Salesman named Polson had his credit cards lifted... Algren nods over to the parking lot opposite. ALGREN (continuing) One of Polson\\'s cards rented that green coupe. VANZANT Not too much for a big rough tough gunfighter like you to do on this one... Cates smiles at the verbal positioning he\\'s used to with his colleagues. CATES Suspect packed or is this a laugher? ALGREN Five and dime stuff. Polson said a kid with a switchblade mugged him and drove off on a motorcyle. CATES Yeah, well, I guess you two are experts at taking boy scout knives away from teenagers... VANZANT Yeah, we are, that means you can stay outta this one. We don\\'t have any big need for the artillery Vanzant\\'s turn to smile. CATES Hey, I\\'m just offering to help out... I like to watch real pros work. VANZANT Help, huh? Sometimes your kind of help tends to leave the suspect in bad shape. Algren...mediator... soothes the competitive situation. ALGREN Hey, relax ... Jack, you wanna come inside, fine... You can stake out the lobby... Cates, a bit disgusted at the politics of this moment, nods... CATES Fine, it\\'s your show... The three men move toward the Walden. WALDEN HOTEL LOBBY Frizzy Blonde still behind the desk. Still reading the lurid paperback. Unaware as Vanzant and Algren approach... She looks up as they flash their badges. FRIZZY Aw, you guys were in last week. You better ask around. I\\'m not supposed to be hassled... I got friends. VANZANT Hey, park the tongue for a second, sweetpants, we just want to search a room. FRIZZY Not unless you got a warrant. CATES Maybe you should of been a lawyer instead of a dumb skirt workin\\' behind a register. Frizzy turns to find Cates standing beside her. He nudges her aside. Starts going throught the register book. FRIZZY Aw, come on, what the shit is this? ALGREN We\\'re looking for a guy going under the name Polson... Frizzy sits back down in defeat. FRIZZY Okay, big deal. Get it over with. Cates finds the name. CATES Mr. Polson, room 27... ALGREN Is he alone? FRIZZY Naw, his sister went up an hour ago. Vanzant turns to Cates. VANZANT Okay, like we said, you stake out the lobby. CATES Sure. Great. Whatever. VANZANT You\\'re not missing out on Dillinger. This punk just stole some credit cards. Cates watches the two Detectives head for the elevator. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR Vanzant and Algren move down the hallwayStop at the far end. Both Detectives draw their pistols and approach a door. ROOM Summer dress and undergarments scatteredon the floor. LISA, lies naked under the covers. She matches Ganz\\'s earlier requirements.Smoking a cigarette, staring at the ceiling. Ganz remains on top of the blanket. Still in his shirt and pants watching TV. Three sharp knocks at the door. Ganz reacts as if he\\'s received an electric shock. His hand goes under the pillow... Comes up with an automatic. Shoves it hard into Lisa\\'s stomach. LISA Hey... GANZ Shut up. LISA What the hell\\'s wrong? I didn\\'t do anything. Another knock. Ganz makes her move to the door. LISA (continuing) What do you want? What\\'s goin\\' on? GANZ Shut up. She grabs her dress and tries to pull it on. GANZ (continuing) Now ask who it is. Shoves harder with the pistol. GANZ (continuing) Come on, ask. She calls out. LISA Who is it? CORRIDOR Vanzant and Algren stand back from the door. Guns held ready. ALGREN Police... open up. R00M Lisa looks from the door back to Ganz. Then at the gun held against her. She\\'s petrified. GANZ Stall. LISA What do you want? VANZANT Police business. Come on, open up. A smile on Ganz\\' face. Almost as if he\\'s enjoying the moment. GANZ Keep stallin\\'. LISA Alright, I\\'m coming...hold on. I\\'ll just be a minute. CORRIDOR Vanzant and Algren waiting. Sounds of movement from within the room. LOBBY Cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell. Looks across at mirror on the wall opposite. The entire lobby covered from this spot. Every angle, including Frizzy. ROOM Ganz gestures to Lisa. LISA Just a second. Ganz belts her with his gun; she falls..Ganz goes through the connecting door. Slips into the adjacent room. BILLY\\'S ROOM Another Hooker cowers in the corner, pulling on her clothes. She\\'s a Mexican girl in a ridiculous \\'Indian\\' outfit. MEXICAN GIRL Que paso? Que esta pasando? No entiendo... BILLY Shut up. Billy goes to where Rosalie is awkwardlytied to a chair with an electric dord. He pulls her to her feet as Ganz moves by. BILLY (continuing) When I say jump, girl, you better jump. BILLY (continuing) CORRIDOR Vanzant reaches down, tries the knob. Locked. Algren moves back, preparing to kick the door down. ADJACENT ROOM Ganz opens the door behind the two cops. Raises his pistol and fires. Billy\\'s shots follow immediately. Hits Vanzant. Algren rolls just as Ganz fires again. Wounded, he gets off three shots, then moves inside Ganz\\' room. Ganz and Billy run for the elevator... Exchange two more shots with Algren. The Mexican Girl begins screaming in Spanish... LOBBY Cates draws his .44. Races up the stairs three at a time. Frizzy starts to frantically call the police. CORRIDOR Cates stops at the landing. Vanzant\\'s body sprawled across the hallway. Algren back in the corridor, still losing blood... Leans against the wall for support... Lisa staggers out of the room, screams. Algren points the gun toward the elevator. Indicating where Ganz and Billy have just fled. Cates starts back down toward the lobby. ELEVATOR Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward. Rosalie is terrified, sobbing... CATES Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase. He takes the next flight in two jumps. ELEVATOR As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to wait as he heads for the lobby. LOBBY Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears. He slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with his pistol. Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun... Cates again slams him with his pistol, felling him... GANZ Slides across the floor. CATES Senses something ... moves just as Billy appears behind and fires at him. The bullet takes out a window. Cates dives over the desk. Another bullet chews up the wood. LOBBY Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming... Cates\\' move and the accompanying bulletspanic her. She dashes for safety... Cates gets to his feet behind cover. Sees Billy holding Rosalie by the throat. Frizzy begins to scream. GANZ He\\'ll blow her goddamn head off. Cates doesn\\'t miss a beat. He slowly levels his .44. Takes careful aim and starts to fire at Billy. ROSALIE No. No. Cates\\' shot narrowly misses Rosalie. The bullet smashes into a mirror above Billy\\'s head. Cates keeps moving closer, gun pointed straight ahead. Billy pushes the pistol against Rosalie\\'temple. For the first time, Cates hesitates. They face each other across the length of the lobby. ALGREN Struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby. He still holds his revolver. Dares not raise it towards Billy and Rosalie. BILLY BEAR Covers Algren from near the entrance. He\\'s confused, doesn\\'t know what to do... He keeps hold of Rosalie. GANZ His eyes catch Algren\\'s... GANZ You. Drop it and we won\\'t kill her. Algren tosses his gun to the floor. GANZ (continuing) Now, tell him to drop his Goddamn piece. ALGREN Do it, Cates. No response. ALGREN (continuing) Do it, Cates. Goddamn it, do it. Cates lowers his gun. Finally lets it drop to the floor. GANZ Kick it over here. Cates does; Ganz picks it up, smiles, looks at Billy. GANZ (continuing) Get the car. Then back to Cates as Billy runs out the entrance with Rosalie. GANZ (continuing) Your gun\\'s just like mine. He\\'s going to kill Cates. But first be glances at Algren. Then, almost casually, shoots him twice with Cates\\' .44. Algren staggers back. Dead before he hits the floor. Cates twists sideways just as Ganz fires. The bullet misses. Again Frizzy starts screaming and struggling. Ganz swipes the woman across the head with the gun. Her body slumps to the floor. Police sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an attempt for Algren\\'s gun. A bullet splatters against the floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. The gun skitters out of reach. CATES You lying son of a bitch... GANZ What are you talking about? We didn\\'t kill her ... Ganz smiles. With your own gun, cop. How does it feel? Cates leaps into a wooden phone booth. Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth with both his and Cates\\' gun. Two bullets crash into the booth. Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are ominously near. Ganz finally retreats out the entrance. STREET Billy and Rosalie weave their way across street to the Cougar. They make a U-turn. Ganz runs out. Car pulls out, then the police cars and vans begin to arrive. PHONE BOOTH Chunks of wood on the floor. Shafts of light through a dozen bullet holes. Shattered receiver dangling from a cord. Cates, wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle. He drops to the floor. LOBBY The police arrive. Swarm into the hotel. All eyes on Cates as he rushes to Algren. Too late... Cates realizes Algren is dead. He cradles Algren\\'s head as he stares at the arriving TAC Squad and Patrolmen. TRANSITION. SQUAD ROOM DAY Cates walks in. Several Detectives gather around him. FAT COP What happened? CATES Read the report. OLD COP Two cops blown away by a credit card booster... that don\\'t figure. CATES No shit. FAT COP They were good cops. CATES They were good cops who fucked up and got careless. A snotty YOUNG COP paces. YOUNG COP That\\'s what you say, Cates... CATES Yeah. YOUNG COP But that\\'s what you say about all of us all the tine ... we\\'re always the ones fucking up when you tell it... CATES The truth hurts, doesn\\'t it, buddy? Cates looks at the Old Cop. OLD COP It don\\'t figure. CATES I need to borrow a piece. The OLD COP shrugs... looks in his desk... YOUNG COP Somebody steals your gun, you\\'re supposed to file a report. CATES Are you gonna tell me about police procedure? Do me a favor, don\\'t give me a bunch of crap. YOUNG COP I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible... Cates loses it for a second, lands on him with both hands, pushes him against a wall... The room goes quiet. Cates cools down. CATES Just shut the fuck up. The other cops don\\'t intervene. They just watch. Cates cools down, straightens up. HADEN walks by, or, rather, speeds by. HADEN Cates, I\\'ll need to see you in five minutes, exactly five. The Old Cop hands Cates a gun, a traditional Army .45... OLD COP Best I can do. HADEN D\\'you read me, Cates... Haden continues moving away. CATES Five minutes. I heard you, your voice carries... As Cates is examining the gun, RUTH, a lab technician, enters and drops three 8 x 10\\'s on the desk near Cates. RUTH They\\'re still wet. Cates lifts the blow-ups, each one showing a different aspect of a spent bullet. RUTH (continuing) Lots of people getting shot with .44\\'s lately ... Last year, it was Saturday Night Specials..now it\\'s heavy stuff. People must be getting madder about something. Cates starts pinning the blow-ups onto a large bulletin board on the wall. Nearby, at the same time (within Cates\\' line of sight, within earshot), Lisa, the Hooker, is being interrogated by a POLICE-WOMAN who pulls the statement off the typewriter. Nearby, the Indian Hooker is being interrogated in Spanish. POLICEWOMAN You\\'re an accessory to Murder One, so you\\'re going to have to do a whole lot better than what we got down here, honey... LISA Gimme a break, huh? ... Look, I got there. He was a trick just like any other for all I knew. That\\'s all there is. He didn\\'t feel like sitting and talking. He was in a big hurry to get laid. I was with him about an hour... Cates has gotten interested in the last part of this ... drifts toward her... A DETECTIVE comes through, begins distributing I.B.M. printouts to Cates, the other nearby officers.. DETECTIVE We got a print from the hotel room. Guy\\'s real name is Ganz, Albert Ganz. A hitter from back East but he worked out here a few years back. Armed robbery. Broke out of prison two days ago and capped two of the guards. A real animal. Wait\\'ll you see this... Cates reads the printout, then smoothly,imperiously, he takes over the questioning of Lisa. CATES Did he give you a return match? LISA He wasn\\'t interested. CATES Maybe he didn\\'t like your performance. LISA Fuck you. CATES I\\'ll take a raincheck... From the side, Ruth is pointing at the photos... RUTH This\\'ll interest you, Jack...we\\'ve got something here from your gun... and these are from the first weapon Ganz used... CATES I don\\'t get it. RUTH Here. CATES She turns, produces the third photo. Pins it beside the one from the Walden Hotel. RUTH A perfect match for the markings from the first gun he used... but not from the Walden Hotel... fired at least six hours earlier...at point blank range... right between the eyes. Found him on a park bench... She shows him two more pictures. Police forensics shots of Henry Wong ... very dead on the park bench... RUTH (continuing) Ya know, there are some very bad people out there in the world. CATES Look at it this way, Ruth. If there weren\\'t, what would there be for us to do? Lisa continues with the Policewoman. LISA Anyway... so I got there and took him down. He started watching television and then you sensational people started banging on the door... that\\'s all... except ... he\\'s gonna give you guys a hard time. CATES Cates looks up as he hears that remark. Notices KEHOE, another Detective, entering with a long suitcase. POLICEWOMAN What makes you think so? LISA I think he liked shooting cops a lot more than getting laid. Cates watches Kehoe unpack the box. CATES Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel? KEHOE Every last bit of it. The big guy\\'s room was empty. CATES I\\'ll help you out. Cates and Kehoe start going through the suitcase. Kehoe produces a speed loader for a .44... KEHOE This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he\\'s got yours. CATES Shit. Kehoe next produces several boxes of shells. KEHOE This cat was real serious about his artillery. An Attendant comes through, hands Kehoe a file. He opens it, shows the file to Cates who reads the name under the mug shot. CATES Billy Bear... KEHOE Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang. Kehoe opens the second file. Four mug shots are inside. CATES Who are all these? KEHOE They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago. CATES Wait a minute, wait a minute... who\\'s this? KEHOE Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job. Cates spins the file around so that both Ruth an Kehoe can see it, throws the forensic shots down beside it. CATES Tell me that\\'s not the same guy. KEHOE Hey ... Dick Tracy. RUTH Did Ganz have a grudge against his old friends? Haden comes out of his office. HADEN Get in here, Cates. Cates ignores him. CATES I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. Can we find them? KEHOE Here\\'s the file. Cates checks the file. CATES One of em\\'s in the slam. HADEN Damn you, Cates ... Get in here. Cates walks into Haden\\'s cubicle. CATES I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun. HADEN Yeah, I read the report... Haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore Cates. CATES Hey, the bastard\\'s got my gun. I want it back. HADEN Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can\\'t seen like we\\'re in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth\\'s a little different. Cates almost smiles at Haden. CATES Yeah... HADEN Anthing botherin\\' you besides losin\\' your gun? CATES Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I\\'m makin\\' a play. I don\\'t like it. HADEN You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack. CATES Being a hot dog\\'s worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead... HADEN Okay. You\\'re not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine. Nail this guy and make us all look good. But you better watch your ass. If you screw up, I can promise you, you\\'re goin\\' down. CATES You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go. HADEN Jack? CATES Yeah? HADEN Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one. CATES I\\'ll keep it in mind. Leaves. TRANSITION. CITY STREET Heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Cates stands near a hot dog stand. Elaine joins him. Cates is eating a hot dog and studying a police file. ELAINE Great place for lunch. CATES Yeah, one of my favorites. ELAINE You made the front page. He hands her a dog. CATES Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day... ELAINE Jack, are you okay? CATES Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there\\'s this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ... He points to the file. ELAINE I thought you might come over to my place to recuperate. I don\\'t have to go to work until the day after tomorrow. They begin to stroll down the street. CATES I got nothing to recuperate from. There\\'s a guy out there with my gun, and I want it back. She\\'s not happy with this attitude. ELAINE Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun... CATES Bullshit? I\\'ll tell you about bullshit. My gun\\'s a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it. It isn\\'t my macho bullshit that\\'s killing people, my gun is ... ELAINE Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you\\'ll turn into a bad cop. It\\'s not a practical way to function... CATES I didn\\'t get burned, two cops did. Listen, I\\'ll tell you about personnel responsibility. I like to get the job done right. And if I don\\'t get my job done right... I\\'m for shit. ELAINE Here it comes again ... the sacred job... CATES That\\'s right. I\\'m not like you. I\\'m not gonna sit on my ass wondering what\\'s right and what\\'s wrong... There\\'s a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I\\'m gonna get him. Because it\\'s my job. And if you don\\'t get that... ELAINE I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don\\'t like it. Pause. CATES No one asked you to like it... But that\\'s the way it is. TRANSITION. PRISON CELL BLOCK - DAY Cates and a GUARD on the upper deck approaching the door to the cell block... The Guard shouts upward. GUARD Open Nine. With a huge metal clatters the door to the cell block opens. CELL BLOCK - NEAR ENTRANCE Cates and the Guard go through the door. GUARD Close Nine. They move forward together. GUARD (continuing) It\\'s Number Twenty-two... You want company? CATES No, no thanks. The Guard shrugs, stays by the door. CATES He walks down the cell block. Inmates stare at him from inside the stark cells. They don\\'t know who he is, but they can smell a cop. Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside... a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and taste. The paint is fresh; there\\'s framed prints on the wall instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods to the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch and the door opens. HAMMOND\\'S CELL Cates steps inside. Hammond is at a table wearing a Sony Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain pen. He\\'s boogeying in his seat to the music. Sprawled on a bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond\\'s age. Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. He doesn\\'t even look at Cates. CATES Hammond. Cates steps inside the cell. CATES (continuing) Hammond! No answer. Cates leans over, hits the override button on the Sony. CATES (continuing) Hammond! Hammond jumps, grabs his ears in pain ... He pulls the headset off and glares at Cates. HAMMOND You got a name, cop? CATES Try Cates. And let\\'s talk in private, okay? HAMMOND Sure, anything you want. He tosses the Walkman to Leroy who dutifully puts it on. CATES Look, convict, I know all about you. Single. No fixed address. No known relatives. One previous conviction. Armed robbery... six months to go on a three-year sentence. HAMMOND You here to write my life story? CATES Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help. Cates takes the forensic photo out of his pocket, passes it across the table to Hammond. He looks at it, hardly reacts. HAMMOND Henry Wong... My old pal. He\\'s looked better... He passes the photo back. HAMMOND (continuing) Look, I got just six months before gettin\\' out of here. Six months between me and freedom after bein\\' here three years... And I\\'m not gonna do anything to screw it up, includin\\' pee in the prison yard, knock up the Warden\\'s daughter or rat on my old partners... Cates swings the cell door back open. CATES Too bad, Reggie. I thought maybe you were a smart boy. But I guess if you were real smart you wouldn\\'t be a convict. He smiles, decides to play his card. CATES (continuing) I can see a second-rater like you wouldn\\'t be any help at all goin\\' up against a real hard case like Ganz. Hammond jerks his head around. HAMMOND Ganz? Pause. HAMMOND (continuing) Ganz the one who shot Henry? Cates, I asked you a question... Cates smiles. CATES Yeah, I noticed... HAMMOND Ganz is in jail. He\\'s gonna be there two years after I\\'m on the street. CATES Didn\\'t work out that way. He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie. He turns, goes out. The door clangs behind him. Hammond jumps up and bangs on the bars, shouts at Cates\\' back... HAMMOND Cates, Come back here. Cates turns, saunters back, leans against the door. CATES Yeah? HAMMOND I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first. CATES You\\'re crazy. HAMMOND I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out. I got to be on the street. Get me outta here. CATES What\\'s the big deal about you bein\\' on the street? HAMMOND I got a lot to protect. CATES Bullshit. HAMMOND It\\'s the only way you\\'re gonna get Ganz. CATES I\\'ll think about it. TRANSITION. Cates typing several of official looking documents while seated across from a rather dour-looking bureaucrat named BOB. CATES Let me borrow your pen, Bob. Handed over by Bob. BOB You going to use your own name? CATES Shit, no. CANDY He begins signing the documents. BOB Jack, just remember one thing. If all this comes down, you don\\'t know me. I\\'m not gonna burn for you. And I\\'ll tell you something else. If it all comes down, your ass is new-mown grass. CATES Right. Hey, no sweat. He hands over the papers. Smiles. BOB BOB You got him for 48 hours. Bob studies the sheet. BOB (continuing) You got a big career as a forger if you decide to go that way, Jack... I\\'ll ring security. TRANSITION. PROCESS ROOM - PRISON - DAY The GUARD leads Hammond to a steel cage. Harmnond\\'s now wearing a beautifully tailored plaid suit. The Guard shouts to ANOTHER GUARD on the far side. GUARD Prisoner G21355 ... Hammond. SECOND GUARD Okay. Send him through. The gate slides open. The Guard geztures for Hairmond to enter. Hammond walks to the far side of the pen. The first gate closes, the second one opens. Hammond turns and walks over to Cates. The Guard comes up to Cates, double checks his orders then unlocks Hammond\\'s cuffs. GUARD Gotta sign for him. CATES Sure thing... He looks over at Hammond who smiles at him. Then looks at Harmond\\'s clothes... CATES (continuing) This prison gives out $400 suits? HAMMOND What are you talkin\\' about? This suit\\'s mine. It cost $900. Hammond dusts off a sleeve. CATES We\\'re supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers... HAMMOND Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies... Cates hands some papers to the Guard. GUARD He\\'s all yours. The Guard walks away as Hammond feels Cates\\' lapel. HAMMOND We could change this for something good...Get you lookin\\' sharp for pussy. Cates gives him a look. CATES I don\\'t need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of... HAMMOND You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me. Cates slaps a cuff on Hammond\\'s outstrethand, then puts the other on his own wrist. HAMMOND (continuing) Hey, no way. Take off the bracelets or no deal. CATES You just don\\'t get it, do your Reggie? There isn\\'t any deal. I own your ass. HAMMOND No way to start a partnership. CATES Get this. We ain\\'t partners. We ain\\'t brothers. We ain\\'t friends. I\\'m puttin\\' you down and keepin\\' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead. And if Ganz gets away, you\\'re gonna be sorry we ever met. HAMMOND Shit. I\\'m already sorry. Cates yanks on the cuffs. They move away. ? TRANSITION. OUTSIDE THE JAIL - DAY CATES LEADS HAMMOND OUT. THEY HEAD FOR CATES\\' BATTERED CADILLAC. HAMMOND This your car, man? CATES Yeah. HAMMOND It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers. As they approach the car... CATES Okay, let\\'s get down to it. I did my part and got you out. So now you tell me where we\\'re goin\\'? HAMMOND Don\\'t worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz\\'ll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away. CATES Luther was part of the gang? HAMMOND What gang you talkin\\' about, Jack? CATES I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack. HAMMOND Just an expression man, don\\'t mean nothin\\'. Cates gets behind the wheel and kicks the engine over. CATES I don\\'t give a damn. It happens to be my name. HAMMOND Then what\\'re you complainin\\' about? At least nobody\\'s calling you shithead.... CATES I may call you worse than that. Cates drives off. EXT. STREET - MISSION DISTRICT - DAY Cates\\' Cadillac purrs into view, entering a deserted street within a rundown neighborhood. INT. CADDY Hammond seated next to Cates. HAMMOND Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don\\'t bother knockin\\' on the door. Luther ain\\'t the kind of guy that looks for company. CATES Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me? HAMMOND Luther ain\\'t the reliable type. I don\\'t want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me. CATES I\\'m helpin\\' you, huh? Hammond smiles. HAMMOND Yeah. Didn\\'t you know that? STREET The Caddy pulls to a stop. HAMMOND Over there...232... Cates double-checks his .38. HAMMOND (continuing) You better let me borrow one of those. Cates smiles. CATES Sure thing, asshole. Handcuffs Hammond to the door handle. Grabs the car keys. CATES (continuing) You just hang on. And hope this big move of yours turns out to be something. Opens the car door. CATES (continuing) LUTHER\\'S VICTORIAN Cates knocks at the door. Nothing. Knocks again ... no response.. From inside, he hears a faint noise but no response to the knock. Holding the .38 in one hand, Cates tries the knob with the other. The door opens. Cautiously, Cates steps inside. INT. LUTHER\\'S VICTORIAN Long corridor ahead. No sign of Luther. CATES Moves down the corriaor, checks the rooms off to one sides. LUTHER LUTHER slips into the hallway behind Cates... Cates turns just as he gets to the kitchen. Luther holds a gun. Cates drops to a crouch and aims the .38. Luther whirls and fires at Cates. As wood and plaster fly out all round him, Cates makes a running dive for the floor. Luther runs out before Cates has regainehis feet. STREET Luther rushes out the front door and heads toward the Cadillac. HAMMOND Watches as Luther heads down the sidewaltoward him. As he starts to pass by... Hammond steps out suddenly... Flattens him with the car door. Luther drops, stunned. Hammond, still restricted by being cuffed to the door handle, reaches and grabs his pistol. CATES Hammond, Drop the Goddamn gun. Hammond looks up. He sprints across the pavement. Aims his gun at Hammond. HAMMOND Quit playin\\' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man. CATES I\\'m tellin\\' you to drop the Goddam gun. HAMMOND I got a whole thing about people pointin\\' guns at me. CATES Just throw me the Goddamn gun. Long moment. Then Hammond smiles and tosses him Luther\\'s pistol. Luther groans. Cates puts his foot on Luther\\'s belly and pulls himself into a standing position, cuffs him. HAMMOND Luther, I always told you the physical side of life wasn\\'t your gig. Look at you, all messed up... Course you never were much in the snappy dresser department, were you? Cates now has Luther ready to be questioned. CATES Come on, talk to him. Hammond turns to smile at Luther. HAMMOND What\\'s happening, Luther? LUTHER I thought you were inside... HAMMOND Meet my travel Agent. Luther leans forward, looks straight at Cates. LUTHER A cop... CATES I sure ain\\'t his fairy godmother... now I\\'m looking for Ganz...where is he? LUTHER Haven\\'t seen him for years. That\\'s the truth. CATES You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is. LUTHER Who gives a fuck what you think? Cates grabs the still open Cadillac door, slams it into Luther. He falls backwards. Cates looks at Hammond. CATES Hey, this works pretty good. HAMMOND Thank you. CATES Want to try it again? Luther sits up again, glares at Cates. LUTHER Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie. CATES I think I met her. Now tell us something we don\\'t know, like where they stashed her. LUTHER I don\\'t know. Cates slams the car door agains him again. HAMMOND I gotta tell you he\\'s having a ball with this car door, Luther... You\\'d better think of somethin\\' to tell him. Luther besitates...flashes a look at Hammond, who sends him a silent fleeting reply. Maybe Cates sees this. Maybe not. LUTHER He ... he wants me to help him skip town. CATES When? How? LUTHER I dunno ... he\\'s gonna call me... Another look at Hammond. LUTHER (continuing) He\\'s gonna call me on...Tuesday. Something\\'s wrong with all this. Cates isn\\'t sure just what. Not yet. He looks at Hammond. CATES What do you think? HAMMOND I think you better put him on ice, man. CATES He\\'s gotta take that call ... if there is one. HAMMOND If you let him run around till Tuesday, he\\'s gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain\\'t you, motherfucker? Luther makes a play toward Hammond, who laughs, doesn\\'t even flinch. HAMMOND (continuing) Luther, are you angry with me? Cates wrestles Luther into the back seat, turns to Hammond. CATES I don\\'t know what the hell you\\'re smiling about, watermelon. Your big move turned out to be shit. HAMMOND Just stares at Cates, keeps smiling... TRANSITION. BOOKING - POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT Two Uniforms follow a sullen Luther, Cates and Hammond to the DUTY SERGEANT... Cates speaks to him through the small window. CATES Assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon. Carrying a concealed weapon. Resisting arrest, Disturbing the peace. Public nuisance... The Sergeant begins typing out an arrest form. CATES (continuing) I\\'ll think up a few more and file the report tomorrow. Cates looks back at Hammond as Luther is hauled away. CATES (continuing) Come on, I gotta make a phone call. As they move through the honeycomb of office partitions. CATES (continuing) You stay with me. Cates picks up the phone on the other side of the booking desk. Dials ... waits for a response as TWO HOOKERS are led past by an Arresting Officer. Hammond gives them the eye. CATES (continuing) This is Jack Cates. Any messages? ELAINE\\'S APARTMENT Elaine is on the kitchen phone, speakingwhite putting her coat on over her uniform for the evening. One look at the way it is cut and you know why she hates her job. ELAINE Just one. Some lady called. Said she\\'s a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She\\'d like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it\\'s humanly possible.... CATES Elaine, look, I\\'m in the middle of sone stuff right now... I\\'m not gonna have time to come by. I don\\'t know when I can get there. Her face falls. Making the offer was hard enough. ELAINE Come on, Jack ... you\\'re making me work too Goddamn hard at this... Jack is very irritated by this turn of events. CATES Listen, Goddamn it if you think I\\'m happy about it, you\\'re nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay? ELAINE This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave. Cates says nothing. She hangs up angrily. BOOKING Hammond is working on the girls. HAMMOND Excuse me, ladies, you seem to be in need of assistance. HOOKER TWO Look, we got enough problems, we don\\'t need no tight-ass court- appointed lawyer trying to bullshit us! HAMMOND Sweetheart, I\\'m not trying to bullshit you. I don\\'t know whether or not you ladies heard but the city is coming down real hard on people practicing unlawful carnal knowledge. HOOKER ONE So what are you trying to say, fella? HAMMOND I\\'m trying to say that you\\'re not just walk in that courtroom and get gonna slapped with a $50 fine and be back on the street turning tricks tonight. You both are going to do some time. About 30 days each... Unless, of course,we talk real business. HOOKER TWO So where do you want to do it, honey? You wanna hop up on the counter? HAMMOND No, we can go to the back room. Cates walks over and pulls him by the shoulder. CATES We\\'re on the move. Let\\'s go. As they walk toward a corridor. HAMMOND Do you know how close I was to getting some trim. And you fucked\\' it up. CATES Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn\\'t get you out so you could go on a Goddamn \"trim\" hunt... stop moaning. HAMMOND Speakin\\' of moans my Stomach is startin\\' to growl. CATES We eat when I say we eat. HAMMOND Bullshit ... I ain\\'t moving till I get something to eat. You\\'ve been treating me like shit ever since I came out here. If you don\\'t like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye. And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music... CATES Yeah, I\\'m hungry too. I know of a place. Let\\'s go eat. HAMMOND Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor. TRANSITION. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS Cates and Hammond at a candy machine. Cates drops in a quarter, throws Hammond a candy bar... CATES There\\'s your God-damn dinner. Now, let\\'s go. They move toward a row of parked cars. AT THE CADDY HAMMOND Who\\'d you call on the phone back at the booking station? CATES Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut. Hammond gets in the car as Cates readjusts Elaine\\'s scarf on the mirror. HAMMOND Must of been your lady friend... Cates frowns at him. HAMMOND (continuing) You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what\\'s her problem besides you? CATES She\\'s got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population. She can\\'t get the job she\\'s trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care? Cates climbs in behind the wheel of the Cadillac. HAMMOND No, man, tell me about her. In jail they got me surrounded by guys wearin\\' blue suits twenty- four hours a day. And I ain\\'t built for that. Really? With the clothes you got on you look like you\\'d love it. Cates takes a belt from his flask. CATES Now, where we goin\\', convict? HAMMOND Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian. Cates starts the motor, slams it into gear. Accelerates out to the street. TRANSITION. EXT. CITY STREET NIGHT Cates and Hammon booming along in the Caddy. HAMMOND Come on, Jack. I want to hear about your girl. When were you with her last ... You get what I mean? Smiles. Cates smiles back at him, almost cruelly CATES I don\\'t give out the details. HAMMOND Last night, two nights ago, three? Cates keeps smiling. CATES Last night. HAMMOND You have a good time? Pained expression on Cates\\' face as he comes back to reality. CATES Sure. Then we had a fight this morning. HAMMOND At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her. She got great tits? Cates gives him a hard look. CATES I get the feeling it\\'s going to be real long night. They keep driving. TRANSITION. MISSION DISTRICT - STREET - NIGHT The Cadillac drives slowly past a bar called Torchie\\'s. Stops at the end of the block. CATES Well? HAMMOND It\\'s a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it. CATES This part of town, they\\'ll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you\\'ve got a piece... HAMMOND Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that? CATES If they kick my ass, they\\'ll sure as hell carve yours up... HAMMOND But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin\\' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats... CATES Bullshit. Attitude and experience get you through... Cates and Hammond step out, glance toward the bar. HAMMOND I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for \\'em was a gun and a badge... CATES You need five years training to handle a joint like... Hamnond\\'s had enough of this debate. HAMMOND Hey, you wanna bet? CATES I got two problems. Number one, I\\'m not playin\\' games. Number two, you got nothin\\' to bet with. HAMMOND If we come outta this joint with Ganz\\' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid... CATES Why? Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can\\'t get it up anyway. HAMMOND That\\'s never been one of my problems. Now, stop stallin\\', man, or else admit all this professional stuff you\\'re talkin\\' about is a crock of shit. CATES I\\'ll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once. HAMMOND What are you talkin\\' about? CATES You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he\\'s after a lot more than just gettin\\' out of jail. And whatever it is, you\\'re part of it. HAMMOND I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed. CATES The bet\\'s off. Hammond thinks it over.. HAMMOND Okay, if I lose, I\\'ll tell you anything you want to know... Cates reaches into his pocket. CATES I\\'m gonna enjoy this ... here, I\\'ll even loan you my badge. HAMMOND I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes. He takes the badge anyway as they head for the entrance. TORCHIE\\'S WESTERN BAR They step inside. Hammond reacts to... REDNECK CITY Longhorns mounted over the bar, Rebel Flags, Lone Star Beer, armadillo posters. Even the waitresses wear Stetsons. Rockabilly pounding from the jukebox. A Cowgirl Stripper is doing the grind on a small podium. HAMMOND This place don\\'t seem real popular with the brothers. CATES My kind of place. I always liked country boys. Cates smiles, finds a table in the corner. A Cowgirl comes over to take his order. HAMMOND Takes a deep breath, moves toward the bar. Smiles at the good ol\\' boys. They don\\'t smile back. He sits down at the bar. BARTENDER Yeah. HAMMOND Vodka. BARTENDER Maybe you better have a Black Russian. HAMMOND No, man, I think I\\'ll have a vodka. Hamnond looks around the room. THE BARTENDER places a glass in front of him, picks up the dollar as Harmond flashes Cates\\' shield. HAMMOND You know a big Indian named Billy Bear? He used to work here. The Bartender shakes his head, gives him a scowl. BARTENDER Never heard of him. Hammond lifts the shot glass and throws it through the mirror behind the bar. Sudden silence throughout the room. HAMMOND Now how\\'s your memory doin\\'? BARTENDER Fuck off. I don\\'t know what the hell you\\'re talkin\\' about. HAMMOND Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think. BARTENDER I don\\'t give a shit who you ask. The Bartender walks down toward Cates. HAMMOND Moves away from the bar. He stops at a booth occupied by FOUR COWBOY PUNKS, one a very big man. Hammond grabs him by the arm and pulls him up. HAMMOND Up against the wall, cowboy. The Punk breaks free, aims a massive haymaker at Hammond. Gets a right to the stomach for his trouble. HAMMOND (continuing) Now, I said get over there by that wall ... You hear me, motherfucker... Looks at the others. HAMMOND (continuing) Move it, rednecks. On your feet... He grabs the next by the arm, yanks him up. HAMMOND (continuing) Over there...move your ass. Some of you rednecks seem a little hard of hearing, so I\\'ll repeat it for everybody... I need word on the whereabouts of an Indian that goes by the name of Billy Bear. It\\'s a police matter and you all look like you\\'d just love to cooperate... CATES Quietly sips his beer. The other occupants of the bar watch Hammond herd the four Punks to the end wall. A BIG COWBOY when Hammond isn\\'t looking, he dashes toward the exit, Cates puts out a leg. Sends the Cowboy crashing into a crowdedtable. HAMMOND Turns around at the noise. HAMMOND (continuing) That wasn\\'t necessary, buddy. I got this under control. CATES Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer. The Redneck Punks are now spread-eagled against the wall. Hammond searches the first. He drops a wallet on the floor and moves to the second. A switchblade, some credit cards and another wallet fall to the floor. The last Punk has only a roll of bills. Hammond holds the money up to his face. HAMMOND You\\'re in trouble, big trouble, so you better start talking. Where\\'d a boy like you make a score like this? PUNK It\\'s mine, what the hell... HAMMOND You must a rolled somebody. They don\\'t let punks like you take jobs that pay this much ... you sure you don\\'t know a dangerous Indian, because unless you start talkin\\' I may just have to start looking down your pants with a flashlight... PUNK What kind of cop are you, anyway? HAMMOND I am your most terrible nightmare ... a bad nigger with a badge that entitles him to kick your ass... Hammond turns to the Bartender... HAMMOND (continuing) One of them is under-age. Another attacked a police officer. And you know I ain\\'t found what I came lookin\\' here for yet... Walks back to the Bartender. HAMMOND (continuing) The tall one had a weapon ... you want me to keep on makin\\' a list, or you got the picture yet? He reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses. Jerks the towel, the pyramid capsizes onto the floor. Huge crash as the glasses break into a million fragments. HAMMOND (continuing) Looks like you\\'re on your way to bein\\' outta business, redneck... Now, let\\'s see what can we fuck with next? The Bartender doesn\\'t have the look of a happy man. BARTENDER Okay, okay. The Indian hangs out with a girl down the block. Right where Chinatown starts. She lives on top of the hardware store. Hammond turns, grins at Cates. As far as he\\'s concerned, he\\'s won the bet. Cates nods, slips out the door. HAMMOND I don\\'t give a damn about his girl... BARTENDER Look, give me a break, you\\'re going to have to settle for her place. It\\'s the only thing I know. He looks desperate. BARTENDER (continuing) I\\'m tellin\\' ya, I\\'m giving you all I know. HAMMOND Try obeyin\\' the law once in awhile, and I won\\'t have to hassle you... Turns to go, then turns back. HAMMOND (continuing) But remember this, cowboy, there\\'s a new sheriff in town. Smiles, turns and goes. TRANSITION. STREET - ACROSS FROM TORCHIE\\'S - NIGHT Hammond steps out of the bar. He crosses to Cates by the car. CATES I think you got something for me. Pause. CATES (continuing) The gun you took off that redneck in there. Hammond smiles. HAMMOND You made that move, huh? CATES While you\\'re at it, You can give me the switchblade, too. Hammond reluctantly takes out a .22 automatic, slams it down on the hood of the car. CATES (continuing) Credit cards? Hammond hands them over with the knife. HAMMOND You already got a gun and you owe me a piece of ass. I\\'ll settle for the gun you just took. A long moment. Then Cates slowly lifts the .22 automatic. CATES You did a real good job... Guess you deserve a reward. Removes the clip. Throws it across the street. Hands Hammond the automatic. HAMMOND Motherfucker. He throws the gun away. CATES I sure am. Now let\\'s go get us an Indian. They walk up the block. TRANSITION. STREET - CHINATOWN - NIGHT Neon signs with Sino lettering. CATES AND HAMMOND Walk down the street, spot a shop with a window display of tools. Look up at the darkened apartment windows. They walk to the end of the block. ALLEY Stairwells lead to each apartment above the shops. Cates and Hammond move along the buildings... Arrive at the back of the hardware store. Quietly, they start to ascend the stairs. STAIRWELL The metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door. Cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent window. Between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from a TV set. On the tube, various poses from stridently exercising women. HAMMOND What the shit is that? Looks again. A female form passes by, goes out of the room. CATES There. HAMMOND Must be billy\\'s girl. CATES Come on. DOORWAY Cates gestures to the door lock. Hammond fiddles with it for several moments. The door swings open. They step into a darkened room. APARTMENT Cates takes the .38 from his pocket. He stops near the open bedroom doorway. He looks at Hammond and then both men step quickly into the room. CATES Police! Nobody move! Hammond reaches for the light switch. Takes a heavy blow. Slumps against the door. A Woman\\'s voice screams out. CATES (continuing) Stay where you are! The light goes on. Cates\\' gun points at a YOUNG WOMAN (CASEY) in a flimsy dressing gown. Saturday Night Special held between her palms, police style... A SECOND WOMAN (SALLY) stands beside Hammond at the light switch. Larger and slightly older than the first, she wears a man\\'s shirt. Holds a baseball bat in her right hand. SALLY You better drop it or he\\'s gonna get another one. HAMMOND Hey, talk to here jack. I don\\'t feel like gettin\\' number two along side of the head. CATES I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun. CASEY Don\\'t give me that police shit. You drop it. Pause. CATES Okay, look, don\\'t shoot. I\\'m just reachin\\' for my badge. Cates takes out his badge-Shows it to Casey. CASEY I don\\'t like this bullshit. I\\'ve seen fake badges before. HAMMOND I\\'ll tell you something lady, this guy is a real nervous cop - He\\'s just liable to pull the trigger. Cates takes two steps toward Casey... CATES Naw, I\\'m the calm type. I know you don\\'t want me to shoot you, and I know that you don\\'t want to shoot me. He takes two more steps toward her. CATES (continuing) Shooting a cop puts you away for a long time. Holds out his hand. CASEY You assholes better be real. She hands Cates the gun. Sally prods Hammond with the baseball bat. SALLY Just wait a Goddamn second here, let\\'s see your badge... He snatches the bat out of her hands. HAMMOND Don\\'t have one. SALLY I knew it. Call the cops. Casey walks over to the phone. CATES Tell them it\\'s Cates, Detective 31st District. Then put your clothes on. If you don\\'t answer some questions I\\'m taking both your asses in. After a moment, Casey puts down the phone. CATES (continuing) Now, let\\'s cut out the crap, which one of you sees Billy Bear? SALLY None of your business, cop. The son of a bitch isn\\'t here, and he isn\\'t coming back. CATES You can do better than that. Turns to Casey. CATES (continuing) How about it? CASEY I used to go with him...I don\\'t know where the hell he is. I haven\\'t seen him for two weeks. And I don\\'t think I will. He owes me money... SALLY He\\'s a Goddamn lowlife, the way he treated her. CATES Sounds like a real stormy romance. CASEY I don\\'t much care what it sounds like to you, Cop. All I know is that I went a few laps around the track with him and I ended up with nothin\\' but the short end of the stick. Cates looks over at Hammond. CATES Let\\'s go. HAMMOND Wait a minute. Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us. How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and... SALLY Fuck off. CATES Come on... Hannond starts for the door with Cates. CASEY If you find that bastard, Billy, tell him to stay out of my life. I don\\'t need any more of his macho bullshit. TRANSITION. STREET CHINATOWN - NIGHT The two men walk among the bright neon lights. Neither of them very happy. CATES This sucks. A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I\\'m out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you. HAMMOND You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself. CATES You? Don\\'t make me laugh. You can\\'t take care of shit. You\\'ve been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt. All you\\'re good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin\\'... HAMMOND I\\'m impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night. CATES Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about. I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock\\'s runnin\\' ... A long look at Hammond. HAMMOND Maybe I don\\'t like the way you ask. CATES Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You\\'re just a crook that\\'s got a weekendpass ... You\\'re not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues... They walk past. TRANSITION. STREET ACROSS FROM TORCHIE\\'S - NIGHT They two men walk toward the Cadillac. CATES Okay, Reggie, I\\'m done playing around. I want to know what\\'s going on and I\\'m going to beat the living shit out of you until you tell me. Hammond goes into a street rap. HAMMOND You beat the shit out of me? Don\\'t make me laugh, sucker. You don\\'t know how I\\'d dance on your face? I\\'ll hit you so hard, so many times, you\\'ll wish you\\'d never been hatched. I\\'ll turn your face into cottage cheese. I\\'ll make your girl think you been takin\\' ugly pills. She won\\'t even know who you are, sucker. They stop by the car. Cates takes the gun out, lays it on the hood. Hammond stares at him. Cates next takes out his wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the car fender... Smiles. CATES I guess the first thing I ought, to explain to you, nigger, is I fight dirty. Hits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face. Hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. Cates hesitates ... and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially open car door slamming into Cates. Cates sprawls. HAMMOND So do I. Hammond aims a kick at Cates\\' head. Cates blocks it with crossed forearms, grabs, twists. Hammond tumbles, rolls away from Cates. Both men struggle to their feet, circle each other. Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates, a bit sooner than he expected. Cates smiles. Hammond dances in and out... Cates\\' breathing becomes more labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates\\' defense. Cates clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a brick wall. Hammond is faster... Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at one another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond\\'s back is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the lighter man\\'s agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary... Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at his side... Breath coming like a bellows... Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put him out. CATES Now, you bastard, you going to tell me what\\'s going on... Puffing away. CATES (continuing) ... Do I have to kick the shit out of you some more. They stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and- white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights flashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out, guns drawn. FIRST COP All right, you two. Don\\'t move. CATES NO, no...it\\'s okay...I\\'m police. SECOND COP Yeah, sure. Get your hands above your head. He keeps his gun trained on Cates,and Hammond. CATES My gun and badge are over there. And I\\'m too fucking tired to raise my hands... Hammond rubs the side of his face. Cates falls back against the patrol car. Still fighting for breath. The First Cop lifts Cates\\' wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge, shows it to the other cop. FIRST COP What the hell\\'s going on here? Cates walks over, pockets his gun. SECOND COP I\\'ve got a burglary call. Two women say a couple of hoods broke into their place posing as cops. CATES I was following a lead. We rousted them... Go up and sweet talk \\'em. You can straighten it out. The First Cop checks out Cates\\' badge and I.D. FIRST COP Why don\\'t you do it? We got better things to do than straighten out your messes. CATES So do I. I\\'ll file a report tomorrow. The First Cop takes out his book, starts writing. He\\'s pissed. FIRST COP I gotta file a..Report tonight asshole... CATES Goes with the territory. He grabs Hammond and they head for the Cadillac. TRANSITION. ALL-NIGHT GAS STATION Cadillac parked behind the service area. RESTROOM Hammond looks\\' up at his bruised face in the mirror, then washes up. Cates is one step ahead of him. He rolls up a piece of the wet towel and inserts it over his bleeding gum. HAMMOND Too bad we got interrupted when we did. I was getting ready to finish you off. Cates straightens up from the wash basin. CATES Yeah, right. You want to try again? HAMMOND Naw, you\\'d just call your pals back to bail you out one more time. CATES They saved your ass, convict. HAMMOND One thing\\'s for sure, Jack. That\\'s how you\\'ll tell the story. Cates dries off his face, starts out of the washroom. CATES I\\'ll even put it in my report that way. The door closes behind Cates. Hammond leans back toward the mirror, nudges a tooth with his finger. HAMMOND Motherfucker. GAS STATION PARKING LOT Cates leans on the Cadillac as Hammond emerges. Hammond starts for the passenger side. CATES Wait a minute. Hammond stops. CATES (continuing) You come clean or we\\'re going to go again. Right here, right now. Pause. A long moment; Hammond decides be has no choice. HAMMOND I been waiting a long time for some money. CATES How much? HAMMOND Half a million. CATES Jesus. Hammond smiles his meanest smile. HAMMOND How\\'s that for a number to give you heart failure? Guess you might start to get the picture after all. Mlaybe you\\'re on the wrong side of the old law and order business.. Cates is unmoved. CATES Just tell me about the money. HAMMOND Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It\\'s the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin\\' pretty, livin\\' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who\\'s out there capping people with some cop\\'s gun. CATES He\\'s after your money. HAMMOND You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let\\'s talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep? Cates just looks at him. HAMMOND (continuing) We split 50-50? CATES Not likely, convict. HAMMOND You gonna let me keep any of it? CATES Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven\\'t built up any points. He smiles. HAMMOND Okay, from now on, I\\'m gonna be real good, Jack. Cates smiles back. CATES Where\\'s the money? HAMMOND In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right? Cates smiles. CATES Right, partner. HAMMOND Get this. We ain\\'t partners. We ain\\'t brothers. We ain\\'t friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you\\'re gonna be sorry we ever met. CATES Yeah. Right. They get into the Caddy. Boom away. TRANSITION. The Cadillac moving through the city... Clock on the dashboard showing 4 a.m. Cates at the wheel. CATES (continuing) Where\\'s the goddamn car? HAMMOND You\\'re a real case, you know that, Jack? Smiles. HAMMOND (continuing) This\\'ll show you how smart I am. I got it parked. CATES ...For three years? Let\\'s hope it wasn\\'t a tow-away zone. HAMMOND You just drove by it. The Cadillac makes a screeching U-turn,i swings into the curb. Cates leans out, looks at... PARKING BUILDING Narrow, multi-storied, with a garage-like opening and signals... proclaiming \\'Weekly-Monthly-Long Term.\" CADILLAC CATES Okay, now what? Hammond gets out of the car. Stands on the sidewalk. Stretches. Then gets into the back seats. HAMMOND Since you\\'re wired on benniest you get to stay up and stare at the building. I\\'m tired, so I\\'m going to sleep. They take Sunday off. Place opens at seven o\\'clock Monday morning. Wake me up at a quarter till... Cates stares at the place. CATES You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing. HAMMOND I wasn\\'t sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack. CATES Shit. THE CITY Beyond the skyline, grey streaks of dawn etch the sky. TRANSITION. The Cadillac is pulled up facing the streets down the block from the parking sections Cates walks in through the lot entrance. Threads his way between the lines of parked vehicles Tired and haggard, he carries a paper bag filled with quick-order food. CADILLAC Hammond stretches on the back seat. Cates slams the door shut. CATES I don\\'t want you sleeping on the job. Hammond yawns, eases himself into a sitting position. HAMMOND The place opens in five minutes. Ganz ought to be here soon... Cates tears the paper bag open. Passes a cup of coffee and donut back. He sips his own coffee, adds some whiskey from his flask... pops another bennie. CATES You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time. HAMMOND Not really. I figured Ganz was put down for a long time. And I knew Luther would never job me on his own. He\\'s too chickenshit. CATES Guess what? Luther just got in line. Hammond sits up. HAMMOND What? CATES Musta got some primo bondsman. HAMMOND Jesus Christ. That\\'s a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he\\'s out in 24 hours. I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door. INT. PARKING LOT BUILDING Luther walks up to the window where a bored ATTENDANT reads a comic book. ATTENDANT Yeah? LUTHER I want to pick up my car. He passes across a faded form. ATTENDANT Name? LUTHER Hammond. The Attendant examines the form, surprised. ATTENDANT This is three years old. LUTHER Yeah, I\\'ve been busy. The Attendant opens a key file, begins rummaging in it. ATTENDANT We don\\'t wash \\'em, ya know. LUTHER How about chargin\\' the battery? ATTENDANT That we do. And we put air in the tires. I\\'ll even sell you some gas if you need it. LUTHER Great, just great. The Attendant finds the key, exits the booth. Luther follows to an elevated stack of cars. The Attendant throws a switch, the stack of cars begins to move. STREET Luther drives down the exit ramp in a dated Porsche convertible. The car is covered with a uniform coat of dust, except for the windshield which has been wiped hastily clean. Luther waits for a break in the flow of traffic, drives out. Another street Luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly Cate\\'s Cadillac appears ... starts to tail the Porsche. CADILLAC Cates follows Luther through several turns. The Porsche jerks whenever it speeds up or slows down. HAMMOND Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don\\'t he take it to a car wash? CATES Didn\\'t know you darker people went in for foreign jobs. HAMMOND I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac. ANOTHER STREET The Caddy follows the Porsche. INT. CADDY As they follow Luther. CATES You\\'d think the guy\\'d be smart enough to know he was being tailed. HAMMOND Tryin\\' to save his girl, man. He\\'s in another world. CATES If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I\\'d just leave town. HAMMOND I\\'m tellin\\' you the man\\'s in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl. CATES Oh, yeah, does bein\\' in love make you stupid? ANOTHER STREET The Caddy follows the Porsche. As they follow Luther. CATES I suppose you\\'d never be like Luther and let a woman get to you... HAMMOND I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about \\'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it. CATES That ain\\'t philosophy. That\\'s common sense. ANOTHER STREET The Caddy follows the Porsche. INT. CADDY As they follow Luther. HAMMOND Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther? CATES If they don\\'t tell me what I need to know... HAMMOND Doesn\\'t it get... Tiring? CATES I\\'m not in this \\'cause it\\'s fun. I\\'m not into hitting guys \\'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it \\'cause it works-... HAMMOND You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile... ANOTHER STREET The Caddy follows the Porsche. INT. CADDY As they follow Luther. CATES Maybe Luther hopes Ganz\\'ll give him a piece of your money... HAMMOND If he\\'s hoping that then he\\'s dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin\\', cause I already think he\\'s real dumb. ANOTHER STREET The Caddy follows the Porsche. INT. CADDY As they follow Luther. HAMMOND A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row... CATES Yeah, it doesn\\'t look like he\\'s gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy... ANOTHER STREET The Caddy follows the Porsche. INT. CADDY As they follow Luther, HAMMOND You know, I\\'d be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you\\'ve done with this job. CATES What you don\\'t understand is, I don\\'t give a damn about how this thing looks. HAMMOND No class... CATES Class isn\\'t somethin\\' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you\\'re still a lowlife. ANOTHER STREET The Caddy follows the Porsche. INT. CADDY As they follow Luther. HAMMOND We\\'re getting too close ... Cates, what\\'s the matter, you been takin\\' dumb pills? CATES Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you\\'re the one that landed in jail what\\'s that make you? ANOTHER STREET Luther pulls over to curb and parks. CADILLAC suddenly swings over several lanes of traffic and parks in driveway of parking lot. LUTHER - CATES & HAMMOND\\'S P.O.V. He goes to the trunk. Rummages there ... picks up a flaming red suit. INT. CADILLAC CATES That Goddamn suit is yours? Hammond winces. HAMMOND That was in style a couple years back, man. CATES Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you\\'re all set. Under the suit is a nondescript attache case. Luther takes it, closes the trunk. Beads down the sidewalk. CADILLAC HAMMOND That\\'s the money, Jack. They jump out of the car, follow on foot. STREET Luther hurries along the sidewalk. He reaches the corner, turns quickly... CATES AND HAMMOND Following a little way behind. They pause at the corner, watching the pedestrian traffic move by. Then turn down the cross street after Luther. Follow him down a stairwell. SUBWAY STATION - LOBBY Escalators and open stairwells. Luther enters and pauses by the doorway. Commuters crowd the counters and congregate near the stairwells. More people are seated along hard plastic seats. But no Ganz. And no Billy. Luther moves further into the station. Cates and Hammond enter. They keep Luther fixed between them, 50 feet ahead. Luther seems to be wandering He walks through the shop area and back toward the escalator. Hammond remains near the arcade while Cates blends in with the commuters. Luther puts the briefcase down at his feet and leans against a counter. Next to him, a loud troop of Boy Scouts marches by. A crowd of people from the train area below flows through the lobby obscuring Luther from Hammond and Cates for a moment. Cates steps out to get a better view and suddenly spots Ganz moving through the crowd toward Luther. Be looks over at Hammond across the station and motions. Then they both start moving in on Ganz, trying to intercept him before he gets deeper into the crowd. Ganz moves cautiously through the station. A crumpled newspaper held absently in his hand. He scans the faces of the commuters and spots Luther. Fails to notice Cates and Hammond closing in on him from two directions. A PATROLMAN comes up. Starts chatting amiably with a Boy Scout next to Luther. Ganz hesitates in his approach. He motions Luther to move awaye, but Luther starts to panic when he sees Cates and Hammond closing in... Ganz reacts to Luther, turns and spots the two men. He makes an immediate break for open ground. The Patrolman sees Ganz start to run. The newspaper is thrown to the floor... Ganz swings Cates\\' .44 toward Hammond. PATROLMAN Hey--you! Ganz whirls, his feet slipping on the marble floor. His shot at Hammond goes plowing into the ceiling. The crowd starts to panic and run in all directions. The Patrolman has al ready brought his own gun out. Levels it at Ganz. PATROLMAN (continuing) Put it down. BILLY BEAR Suddenly appears, Rosalie at his side. Billy Bear\\'s .44 blasts the Patrolman onto his back. Ganz comes up and scrambles through the screaming patrons. He, Billy and Rosalie head toward the escalator. Cates has already brought out his .38... Can\\'t get a clean shot through the chaos. Hammond pushes his way through the crowd to Cates. HAMMOND Shoot the sons of bitches. Cates can\\'t risk it... HAMMOND (continuing) You don\\'t want to chance it, then give me the gun... A moment. HAMMOND (continuing) Bullshit. Then i\\'m staying with the money. CATES You stay with me... HAMMOND No way... Hammond starts after Luther. Cates turns, starts to aim at Hammond. Hesitates... PASSENGER WALKWAY Panic has overtaken everyone as they try to escape the madman with the gun. Ganz and Billy elbow and kick their way through the crowd, tugging Rosalie along... Cates, gun in hand, creates further-panic as he moves after Ganz. Ganz grabs a man beside him. Shoves him hard into the passengers in back. The man knocks over several more people creating a roadblock. Ganz vaults over the railing and starts for the trains. Cates loses a few more precious seconds grappling through the terrorized passengers... TRAIN AREA The usually jammed area looks like an empty stockyard. The patrons huddle in fear against any available wall. Cates bursts out of the stairwell... TUNNEL Red and green signal lights. The light goes red, a train roars up and the doors hiss open. Billy and Ganz fight through the passengers getting off the train, jump on board; Billy pulls Rosalie behind him. CATES Running for the doors... Suddenly, a SECURITY OFFICER appears, riot gun in hand. SECURITY OFFICER Freeze! CATES No! No! There they are! SECURITY OFFICER Just put it down real slow. The train doors close. CATES I\\'m a policeman, you asshole! SECURITY OFFICER Don\\'t even try... now drop it or - you\\'re all done. He means it, points the riot gun even closer... The train in front of him moves away. Cates carefully places the .38 on the pavement. Then raises his hands in the air. CATES Shit. TRAIN STATION - LOBBY Witnesses stand in nervous little knots. Give versions of what happened to notepad-toting patrolmen. Hospital Attendants minister to various and sundry complaints. Cates sits on a passenger bench, obviously dejected. A voice comes echoing from behind. HADEN Cates. Haden, silhouetted against the light from the street. HADEN (continuing) What the bell happened? CATES I lost them, that\\'s what happened. HADEN How did they get away? CATES They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train. Haden watches the Morgue Personnel wheel out the body of the Patrolman. HADEN Which one pulled the trigger? CATES The Indian. I was about 30 yards away. HADEN You couldn\\'t get to him? Cates shrugs. HADEN (continuing) What a screw-up. CATES Right. I screwed up. I fucked up. I messed up. Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you\\'re real good at hitting targets through crowds. Haden starts toward the street. Looks back at Cates. HADEN Don\\'t duck the bullet Cates. Why didn\\'t you call in for backup instead of makin\\' a grandstand play? CATES I didn\\'t have the time. HADEN Too bad, it would\\'ve covered your ass. Now you\\'re in the shit and so\\'s the department. In case you haven\\'t noticed, this wasn\\'t our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin\\' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin\\' about writin\\' tickets off a three wheel bike. Cates looks at Haden for a moment... Turns and walks away. TRANSITION.

Word\\'s going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you. CATES Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong. KEHOE Doesn\\'t look like it. CATES Nothing came in for me yet? No calls? KEHOE Nothing. Kehoe\\'s phone begins to ring. Cates watches hopefully. KEHOE (continuing) Kehoe... Okay, hang on. Offers the phone to Cates. KEHOE (continuing) It\\'s for you... Ordinance. Cates\\' excitement vanishes. He takes the receiver. Kehoe begins to clean off his desk. CATES Hello... Yeah, okay. I\\'ll be in tomorrow. That\\'s right, you can depend on it. Okay? He slams down the receiver, leans back in the chair. CATES (continuing) Bullshit red tape. KEHOE I\\'m heading out. How about you? Cates shakes his head. CATES I got to wait for a call. KEHOE Okay.

CATES Elaine, I gotta put you on hold... ELAINE Jack, wait... CATES Just a second, that\\'s all! He hits the bold button, starts rummaging through the desk. Paperwork scatters in all directions. Kehoe watches him in silence for awhile then leaves. Cates begins to dial. CATES (continuing) Hammond... you son of a bitch, where are you? Listens for a moment.

HAMMOND (continuing) They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the \"Don\\'t Disturb\" sign. He\\'s trading his girl for the money. All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind. CATES So you took the rest of the night off... Hammond smiles. HAMMOND We don\\'t have too many cheerleaders in prison. I though I might indulge myself in a little trim. Cates orders two drinks. CATES Tell me something. Why didn\\'t you just take the money off Luther and split? HAMMOND Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you... He opens his jacket slightly. Reveals a shoulder holster and accompanying .45. A long moment. CATES I don\\'t know why, but I\\'m going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I\\'m too tired to argue... HAMMOND You sure that\\'s the reason? Pause. CATES Thanks for callin\\' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I\\'m sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin\\' on ya, doin\\' my job.

All I need is some money for the room. HAMMOND (continuing) Big smile as Cates produces some cash. Hammond counts it eagerly. Looks around. Candy suddenly appears like a trout seeing a lure. She grabs the money. CANDY Hello, again. HAMMOND I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business. As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.

Turns into a narrow street. A BUS STOP Luther waits, impatient. Checks his watch. Looks up and down the street. He double-checks the bus stop sign over his head. Just as a bus pulls to a stop, air brakes hissing ... LUTHER Gets in. Sees that the driver is Billy Bear... BUS The bus starts up. Luther hesitates in the front. On the wide rear seat is Ganz. Rosalie beside him. GANZ Open your coat. Both sides. He shows he\\'s not packed. LUTHER Let her go. GANZ First, the money. Luther takes a step. GANZ (continuing) Just show me. Luther puts the case on a side seat, opens it for display. ANOTHER BUS STOP Commuters look up expectantly. One of two drift toward the curb. Jump back in alarm as the bus roars by. BUS Ganz is satisfied. Luther closes the case. LUTHER Rosalie, you okay? GANZ What are you talkin\\' about? I said I wouldn\\'t hurt her. And then he shoots Luther. Right between the buttons. GANZ (continuing) I never break my word. Laughs as Rosalie begins to scream. CATES\\' CADDY Barreling down the street, ignoring red lights. Hammond shouts over the wind. HAMMOND Notice something funny about that bus? CATES Yeah. It missed the last four stops. Cates pours on the gas. BILLY BEAR His eyes fall on the rear view mirror. A white Caddy dances in the vibrating glass. Billy looks over his shoulder at Ganz. BILLY Ganz! THE CADDY Swerves into cross traffic, makes a big press forward. Comes abreast of the driver\\'s side of the bus. GANZ Smashes a side window with the two handguns. Blasts away. Cates driving with one hand as he draws his gun. CATES Looks up as glass shards sparkle down. He speeds up ... he is neck and neck with the bus. Hammond has a clear shot of Billy Bear who gives a side glance at him; Hammond doesn\\'t shoot... Cates slows down and fires... Billy is hit in the shoulder. Ganz runs up and fires again... Hammond is hit in the arm. Cates grabs Hammond by the shirt. Yanks him close. Throws the wheel over ... CADDY Swerves as bullets pepper the passenger side. Stuffing flies out of Hammondis still warm seat. The right hand windows explode. Then the Caddy spins out. THE BUS Roars away... THE CADDY Skids into a traffic sign, demolishing some newspaper machines. Cates curses, tries to start the car. The engine won\\'t turn over. He looks at the distant bus. CATES Goddamn! Goddamn! Goddamn! Pounds on the dash. What\\'s left of the windshield falls in at the impact. TRANSITION. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT Cates at his desk. Hammond seated nearby, now with a bandaged arm. Haden in front of Cates, furious. HADEN A bus, you goddamn whiskey mick cop, you lost a stolen bus... We got five deaths related to Ganz, all of \\'em law enforcement related, and you blow it for a lousy nigger convict... Cates says nothing... HADEN (continuing) That\\'s rights I called him a nigger. You bet I did ... I saw the report on that little piece of shit. If he spent one legal day in his whole life, it\\'d be a record...This is it for you... suspension, review board... you\\'ve had it. When it gets \\'round you protect a con rather than nail a cop killer... Cates stands up. CATES He\\'s got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I\\'ve worked with. HADEN Just cause you say it with conviction don\\'t mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?. Cates stands. Moves to Hammond. Handcuffs himself to him. HADEN (continuing) Where the Christ do you think you\\'re going? CATES I\\'m taking my prisoner back to jail. Hammond looks at Haden. HAMMOND Goin\\' a little hard on him, aren\\'t you?

I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack\\'s is a friend of mine. Gives her a big smile. ELAINE I\\'m not so sure I can say the same thing...You don\\'t look like a cop. HAMMOND Well, I been workin\\' the other side of the street for the last few years. And you don\\'t exactly look like a shrink, wearin\\' that dress... ELAINE Shrink major, not a shrink. She pours three glasses of cognac. A STRAGGLER at the end of the bar pipes up. STRAGGLER Hey, lady, a drink here. ELAINE We\\'re closed. STRAGGLER Hey, what the hell? Elaine turns to him; it\\'s short and sweet. ELAINE Drink your drink, pay up and get out. STRAGGLER You can\\'t do this. It\\'s against... ELAINE Hey, just fuck off. My friends have guns. Cates holds up his pistol. The man\\'s eyes widen and he turns his angry move toward her into a skedaddle out of the bar. Elaine finishes drying a glass and approaches. ELAINE (continuing) You real down? CATES I\\'ve been better...Dead end. No Ganz, no Indian. He finishes his drink, puts down the glass. CATES (continuing) I gotta call the station. Looks back at Hammond... CATES (continuing) Don\\'t run off anywhere, okay? I\\'ve already got enough to worry about. Moves away. HAMMOND Hard man to live with. ELAINE How would you know? HAMMOND Hey, two days with him is enough. ELAINE That\\'s no bull. She looks at him carefully. They both grin. CATES In the phone booth. CATES Is there any report ... No ... Just tell me... nothing..Yeah I figured... Okay, sure. Hangs up. ELAINE AND HAMMOND Cates returns... CATES Nothing. No sign of Ganz. No sign of the Indian. Airport\\'s clean. Train station. Bus station. Docks... Shit... ELAINE Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody... CATES How do you know? ELAINE Jack, it\\'s all over the papers. He\\'s an obvious type. But this Indian... Hammond cuts in. HAMMOND He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you... ELAINE In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me. The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend. Have you two ace detectives checked that out? CATES Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian\\'s we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend. I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him... HAMMOND Yeah, too bad. They were real nice lookin\\' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV... ELAINE What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes? CATES Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party. ELAINE It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian\\'s girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she\\'s still vulnerable to him. CATES So what? ELAINE When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible. CATES Hey, Come on, shrink time\\'s over. They wouldn\\'t go see some old girlfriend. ELAINE Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out. HAMMOND She\\'s got a point there, Jack. Smiles. Cates reflects for a moment. CATES It\\'s the only thing we got. He looks at Elaine. CATES (continuing) Whaddya think? ELAINE What do I know? I\\'m just a bartender. CATES Let\\'s go, Reggie. He kisses Elaine. HAMMOND Do I get to kiss her too? CATES If she\\'s right, and if you don\\'t screw up. They exit the bar. TRANSITION. EXT. STREET - CHINATOVIN - NIGHT Cates and Hammond hidden in a doorway which affords them a good view of the alley landing to Casey and Sally\\'s apartment. HAMMOND What if your girl\\'s theory turns out to be bullshit? I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro. CATES I\\'ve got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I\\'m gonna know it. A woman appears, turning out to be Casey carrying a shopping bag. HAMMOND Hey, there she is... CATES Whatever play I maker just back me up. HAMMOND If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in. CATES Sure, I\\'ll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps... HAMMOND Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain\\'t no sweetheart... I wouldn\\'t like it if this partnership ended before it gets started. CATES Partnership? HAMMOND Well, you got to admit we come a long way. Cates gives him a smile. CATES Let\\'s just do it. APARTMENT STAIRWELL As Casey opens the door and starts toward the.stairs, Cates and Hammond come through the door and grab her. They are now on the ground floor stairwell. CATES I hear you\\'ve got visitors. CASEY Would you guys... CATES No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I\\'ll rip your lungs out if you don\\'t answer fast. Cates has her by the shoulder and arm; he twists her like a vise... HAMMOND He means it... She looks at Cates, knows Hammond\\'s correct. CASEY Don\\'t kill him. Please, just don\\'t kill him. A long moment. CATES You and the other one, you\\'re still Billy\\'s girls. You always were his girls... CASEY Yeah. Sure, i\\'m crazy in love with him, who wouldn\\'t be... CATES You\\'re gonna help us take him. CASEY No chance. CATES He can live or die ... You let us in and he\\'s got a chance to make it. Otherwise, he gets ventilated. Casey\\'s face is seared with pain at the thought of Billy dying. HAMMOND If you help use he\\'s got a chance, lady. CASEY Billy\\'s in the first room off the hall ... With rosalie ... He\\'s makin\\' her happy tonight. You don\\'t understand about the way it is with him, do ya? CATES Where\\'s ganz? CASEY In the back. Down the other corridor. Cates looks at Reggie. CATES Looks like you\\'re gonna get your chance. They move upward... INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT Cates is stealthily going to the end of the second corridor of the kitchen and living room area. That corridor turns at a sharp angle and goes to the back. Hammond is at the very front of that first corridor..at a door ... he shoves it back. INT. FIRST BEDROOM There is a bed and Rosalie, undressed, is in it... Billy is seated on the edge of it... pants on, shirt off, pulling on his boots. Suddenly, Hammond is pointing a gun at him... HAMMOND Give it up, Billy. You got no shot at it. Billy stands. ROSALIE Don\\'t let him hurt met Billy. You\\'re not gonna let \\'em hurt me, are ya? BILLY He won\\'t hurt you. He ain\\'t gonna do nothin\\' to you, he\\'s just after me. HAMMOND I\\'m tellin\\' ya, Billy, give it up. BILLY I never was much for bein\\' rehabilitated. Billy looks at Hammond. With lightning sudden quickness, he reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back. Billy smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he leaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol. The big slugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as Rosalie shrieks. INT. BACK BEDROOM Ganz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off the bed, pushes Sally out of the way ... opens the door and starts firing furiously down the corridor... He grabs the briefcase and runs to the window. INT. CORRIDOR/DOOWAY TO BACK BEDROOM Cates has ducked the bullets ... he is inching toward the door... He pulls it open...Ganz from the window fires another shot which almost gets him then vanishes down the fire escape... INT. BACK BEDROOM Sally gets to her feett yelling, runs at Cates as he appears and futilely tries to hit him....He throws her down on the bed as if she were a doll ... He goes to the window... EXT. FIRE ESCAPE Ganz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground. He stops for a second... Then Cates appears, Ganz fires a shot then starts to run. Cates keeps coming... INT. FIRST BEDROOM Hammond hears the gunfire, runs out of the room... CATES Dives down the fire escape. BATHROOM Hammond enters to find it empty of Ganz and Cates, only Sally crying hysterically ... He runs out. EXT. CHINATOWN STREET Ganz runs out the back alley ...Cates pursues... ALLEY Hammond runs down the stairs toward the front of the building. EXT. STREET Ganz runs, turns out of an alley onto a street baked with neon light. Cates pursues. EXT. FRONT OF CASEY\\'S BUILDING Hammond runs out, turns down the adjoining street. CATES Following Ganz, holding him in sight, but unable to get a shot off... PARALLEL STREET Hammond running down a street near the one where Ganz is being chased... MAIN STREET Cates fires at Ganz ... Ganz ducks in a doorway... HAMMOND on his street hears the shot... he runs toward it, down a narrow alley between two buildings.... EXT. DOORWAY AT END OF ALLEY Ganz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of Cates. They move very close to where be is crouched... it is Hammond coming toward him... Ganz suddenly rolls a garbage can in his path, dropping him like a stone. CATES Comes toward where he expects to find Ganz... Ganz has his arm around Hammond\\'s throat and his gun to his ear... GANZ Drop it... you come up against me, you\\'re gonna lose... Hammond drops his gun. GANZ (continuing) Hey, cop, come on...l got something for ya... come on... EXT. MAIN STREET Cates comes out of the doorway from which he\\'s fired...and comes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it down when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy. The hand that\\'s around Hammond\\'s throat also holds the black bag. Cates walks forward, his gun down at his side... GANZ After I get outta this, cop...I\\'m gonna live forever... CATES I don\\'t think you\\'re gonna make it. GANZ Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything... HAMMOND Give up. He\\'s crazy. He\\'ll kill us both. Cates still walking... GANZ He won\\'t try it. He\\'s a fucking chickenshit cop. They\\'re all fucking wimps, right, Cates? They are now closer to each other. Ganz holding Hammond and the money... GANZ (continuing) Okay, cop ... give me your gun and I\\'ll let him live. Come on, Cates, you\\'re real good at giving up your gun. Cates keeps the same methodical pace... CATES Sure... Suddenly, he crouches and fires twice. Hammond twists as Ganz also fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet backward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the ground, looks at Cates. HAMMOND Jesus Christ, I didn\\'t think you\\'d really do it. You are crazy. Ganz\\' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side. Cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again. Ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look of childish disbelief passes over his face. GANZ I got hit. I can\\'t believe it. I got shot. CATES You\\'re done. End of story. GANZ I ain\\'t gonna beg for my life. It ain\\'t cool. He runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is stopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his chest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of Ganz\\' now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond... HAMMOND Yours? Cates raises the pistol. CATES Mine... Pause. CATES (continuing) You okay? HAMMOND Yeah. But I wasn\\'t there for a second. CATES You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own... Hammond smiles. HAMMOND Just tryin\\' to get the money, Jack. Just tryin\\' to build up a few points on that merit system. Cates smiles back, picks up the black bag as they move off. TRANSITION. ELAINE\\'S BATHROOM Cates in the tub, steam rushing from the water. Elaine sits on the porcelain edge as he splashes and soaps... ELAINE How\\'d they take it back at headquarters? CATES Usual bullshit. You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin\\', shootin\\' guys sucks. Especially compared to this. ELAINE I\\'ve been waiting a long time to hear you say that. CATES Yeah, bein\\' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works. He reaches out, lifts his watch from his pile of clothes on the floor. CATES (continuing) Three more hours... ELAINE Where is he? CATES Promised I\\'d turn my back while he... ah, never mind... ELAINE Tell me. CATES He\\'s takin\\' care of the same business I\\'ll be takin\\' care of - soon as I dry off. Elaine smiles, leans close. ELAINE You\\'re impossible... CATES That\\'s what I always say. TRANSITION. CANDY\\'S ROOM - NIGHT Minimal crummy hotel room accommodations... Hammond is kissing her at the door, finishing buttoning all his buttons. He reaches for a wallet, gives her several bills. HAMMOND Here you go, baby. CANDY Hey, don\\'t do that. I said I wasn\\'t a pro, remember? HAMMOND Hey, no, I\\'m tryin\\' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I\\'d do it, but I got to go. I got this cop waitin\\' for me... They kiss... it\\'s pretty romantic... She opens the door for him. CORRIDOR She stands at the top of the stairs; as Hammond walks down, he calls back to her over his shoulder ... HAMMOND I\\'ll be back in six months... Maybe I\\'ll make an honest woman of you. He gives her a big sniile. HAMMOND (continuing) I\\'ll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how\\'d that be? Then we\\'ll go dancin\\', okay? CANDY Now you\\'re talkin\\'. See ya... He moves off, still smiling, holding the black briefcase... STREET - NIGHT on a picturesque hill above the Haight. Cates standing near the wheel of Hammond\\'s Porsche. Hammond comes down the porch steps from the hotel. CATES Okay, reggie, start bustin\\' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick. HAMMOND Hey, Jack, real men don\\'t have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic. As a riatter of fact, I was so good, I may have my cock done in bronze. Cates holds up the black briefcase. CATES I guess this is what you want to talk about...All the pretty money that\\'s inside here. Cates takes the case to the trunk, opens it, deposits the case, locks the trunk. HAMMOND Wait a minute, Cates. I\\'ve been waitin\\' three years for that. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand. CATES There\\'s nothin\\' to talk about. Another long exchange of looks. Then be hands Hammond the keys to the trunk. CATES (continuing) It\\'s your money. It\\'ll be here in six months when you get out. HAMMOND And you\\'re tellin\\' me you don\\'t want any of this cash? CATES That\\'s right. Not my style, Reggie.. HAMMOND You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin\\' around out here. CATES No, you don\\'t. If I ever get word of you steppin\\' over the line again, I\\'m gonna ventilate that suit of yours. HAMMOND Spare met Jack. I\\'m into legit investments from here on in. Cates gives him a very skeptical look, as they head for the car. Hammond gets in behind the wheel, Cates on the passenger side. Cates takes out a cigarette, starts to light it. Hammond takes the match does it for him. CATES Thanks. HAMMOND No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook? Where\\'d you get the idea that you could catch me? They both smile. Hammond socks it into gear and they drive off into the far distance... END. '"

The reign of the ter-\\nrible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent\\nwhich would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival\\nhad reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not\\nyet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or\\nthe swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a1\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA2\\nINT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER\\n\\nThe man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and\\nthey were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.\\nAbout twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking\\na small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.\\n\\nThe tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.\\nAs the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher\\ndiscovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know\\nthe Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond\\nhis understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-\\niated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then\\nhe carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the\\nhyenas.\\n\\nAmong his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly\\nfive feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over\\na hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,\\nand his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is\\nlow, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he\\nunmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As\\nhe looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a2\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA2\\nCONTINUED\\n\\nsomething in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those\\ndark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-\\ntions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another\\ntwo million years.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a3\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA3\\nEXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS\\n\\nAs the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach\\nthe shallow stream.\\n\\nThe Others are already there. They were there on the other\\nside every day - that did not make it any less annoying.\\n\\nThere are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish\\nthem from the members of Moonwatcher\\'s own tribe. As\\nthey see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and\\nshriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply\\nIn kind.\\n\\nThe confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies\\nout as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of\\nthe muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has\\nstaked its claim to its own territory.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a4\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA4\\nEXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES\\n\\nMoonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit\\nand leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around\\nthem, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential\\nsource of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet\\nall the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched\\nsavanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;\\nthe idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are\\nslowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a5\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA5\\nEXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION\\n\\nThe tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-\\nside foraging for roots and occasional berries.\\n\\nEight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,\\nabout fifty feet apart.\\n\\nThe ground is flat for miles around.\\n\\nSuddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking\\nthem about 300 yards away.\\n\\nDefenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all\\ndirections, but the lion brings one to the ground.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a6\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA6\\nEXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY\\n\\nIt had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no\\nreal remembrance of the past he could not compare one day\\nwith another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a\\nhive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the\\nfinest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he\\nalso collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices\\nthem. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever\\nlikely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually\\nweak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could\\nhope for.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a7\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA7\\nINT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS\\n\\nOver the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down\\nfrom the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -\\nbut cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;\\nit was merely part of the background of life.\\n\\nThis Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,\\nwas dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher\\ncrawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides\\nthe entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.\\nIf any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back\\nto the relative safety of the cave.\\n\\nOf all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher\\'s\\nrace was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,\\nand though he could not remember it, when he was young,\\nMoonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.\\nNow he new he would have to find a tree that was high\\nenough.\\n\\nHe stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from\\none of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a8\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA7\\nCONTINUED\\n\\noccasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down\\nthere in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,\\nand the thought that he might help in some way never crosses\\nMoonwatcher\\'s mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out\\nsuch fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.\\n\\nAnd in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and\\nfearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations\\nyet to come.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a9\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA8\\nEXT  THE STREAM - INVASION\\n\\nThe Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of\\nthe valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that\\nMoonwatcher\\'s tribe has lost three of its numbers during the\\nnight, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When\\nthey meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a\\ndeeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy\\nbut usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds\\nbefore the invasion begins.\\n\\nIn an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,\\nshieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led\\nby a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher\\'s own size and age.\\n\\nStartled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first\\nadvance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations\\nat the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a\\nmist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own\\nterritory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.\\nHe does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his\\nexperience.\\n\\nThen he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a10\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA8\\nCONTINUED\\n\\ndown, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they\\nmove from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy\\nthey become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original\\ndrive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.\\n\\nAs he sees this, Moonwatcher\\'s own morale immediately\\nrevives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make\\nreassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill\\nhis dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and\\nleadership.\\n\\nBefore he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and\\nthe two tribes come to a halt many paces away.\\n\\nThe disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended\\nquickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this\\ninnovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the\\nfuture. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and\\nscratch and try to bite each other.\\n\\nRolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,\\nand when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a11\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA8\\nCONTINUED\\n\\nhe chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth\\'s scalp,\\nand bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is\\nso satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening\\nIn Big - Tooth\\'s resistance, that he quickly repeats it.\\n\\nEven when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-\\nwatcher keeps up the exhilirating game.\\n\\nWith shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the\\nstream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as\\nThe water\\'s edge.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a12\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nEXT  CAVE - NEW SOUND\\n\\nDozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is\\nstartled by a sound.\\n\\nHe sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his\\nsenses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.\\nNever in his life - already twice as long as most members of\\nhis species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The\\ngreat cats approached in silence, and the only thing that\\nbetrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional\\ncracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise\\nthat grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous\\nbeast was moving through the night, making no attempt at\\nconcealment, and ignoring all obstacles.\\n\\nAnd then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not\\npossibly have identified, for it had never been heard before\\nin the history of this planet.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a13\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA10\\nEXT CAVE - NEW ROCK\\n\\nMoonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he\\nleads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.\\nHe had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing\\nhad happened after that initial noise, so he does not even\\nassociate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There\\nis nothing in the least alarming about it.\\n\\nIt is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of\\nsome completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy\\nto see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.\\nThere are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can\\ncompare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious\\nof most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.\\nAs nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,\\nhard surface.\\n\\nAfter several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a\\nbrilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it\\nmust have grown during the night. There are many plants\\nthat do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that\\nseem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that\\nthey are small and round, whereas this is large and square;\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a14\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA10\\nCONTINUED\\n\\nbut greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be\\nprepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.\\n\\nThis really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher\\nto a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,\\nround pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few\\nthat made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?\\n\\nA few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.\\nThere is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he\\ncontinues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a15\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA11\\nEXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON\\n\\nThey are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the\\nsound begins.\\n\\nIt is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they\\nstand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,\\nmaddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube\\nand hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first\\ntime - and the last, for two million year - the sound of\\ndrumming is heard in Africa.\\n\\nThe throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the\\nhominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards\\nthe source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little\\ndancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that\\ntheir descendants will not create for ages yet.\\n\\nTotally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting\\nthe hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,\\nand the hunger in their bellies.\\n\\nNow, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes\\nfuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a16\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA11\\nCONTINUED\\n\\nrotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-\\neyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.\\n\\nThen by some magic - though it was no more magical than all\\nthat had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It\\nis as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and\\nshifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four\\nhominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher\\'s\\nown tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog\\nlies near them.\\n\\nThis little family of male and female and two children is gorged\\nand replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a\\ncondition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From\\ntime to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the\\nentrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.\\nThe spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally\\ndifferent scene.\\n\\nThe family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;\\nit is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a17\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA11\\nCONTINUED\\n\\nA small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids\\nwithout giving them more than a glance, for they had never been\\nthe slightest danger to its species.\\n\\nBut that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male\\nsuddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -\\nand hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon\\nits skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had\\nproduced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.\\nAnd the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one\\namazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.\\n\\nThen the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds\\nitself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement\\ncan be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the\\npig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene\\nfreezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless\\nabove the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.\\n\\nThe scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a\\nglimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a18\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA11\\nCONTINUED\\n\\nawakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle\\nback to their caves.\\n\\nThey have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that\\nnight, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears\\nattuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher\\nfeels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge\\nto kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a19\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA12\\nEXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia\\n\\nBabies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-\\nyear-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others\\nthreatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.\\nIn the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions\\nhad changed almost beyond recognition.\\n\\nThey had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no\\nlonger haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons\\nwell; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that\\nthe Cube had revealed to them.\\n\\nThey were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they\\nhad time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.\\nTheir new way of life was casually accepted, and they did\\nnot associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing\\noutside their cave.\\n\\nBut no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The\\nfirst was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids\\nseemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better\\nnourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a20\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA12\\nCONTINUED\\n\\nsomehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to\\ndie of starvation.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a21\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA13\\nEXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION\\n\\nWith the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the\\nground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-\\nwatcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two\\nconsecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,\\nbetraying his presences by a small pebble slide.\\n\\nWhen they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,\\nthey strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound\\nof the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave\\nagainst the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their\\nstrength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.\\n\\nThe lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these\\ncreatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost\\nhim his life; he goes back to his meal.\\n\\nThe rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with\\namazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about\\nfifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.\\n\\nJust at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps\\naway from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a22\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA13\\nCONTINUED\\n\\nonrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-\\nconfidence and bad luck.\\n\\nThe next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They\\nalso find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to\\nsee what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small\\nrock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to\\npay for such a great victory.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  * * * * * * * *\\n\\nAnd then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even\\nMoonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly\\nunaware of all that it had done.\\n\\n10/13/65\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t a23\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA14\\nEXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD\\n\\nFrom their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of\\ntheir own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen\\nmales of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-\\nlooking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.\\n\\nThe Others begin to scream their daily challenge.

One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club\\nuntil the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness\\ndown around him.\\n\\nThe Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher\\'s power.\\n\\nMoonwatcher surveys the scene.

The final movie deviates from this screenplay in a number of interesting ways. I\\'ve tried to maintain the format of the original document except the number of lines per page of the original.

Clark Hawk Films Ltd., c/o. M-G-M Studios, Boreham Wood, Herts. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TITLE PART I AFRICA 3,000,000 YEARS AGO ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A1 VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years, and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter- rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist. 10/13/65 a1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A2 INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction. About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream. The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving. As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac- iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the hyenas. Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like, and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already 10/13/65 a2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A2 CONTINUED something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima- tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years. 10/13/65 a3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A3 EXT THE STREAM - THE OTHERS As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach the shallow stream. The Others are already there. They were there on the other side every day - that did not make it any less annoying. There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish them from the members of Moonwatcher\\'s own tribe. As they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply In kind. The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has staked its claim to its own territory. 10/13/65 a4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A4 EXT AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach; the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty. 10/13/65 a5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A5 EXT PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country- side foraging for roots and occasional berries. Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain, about fifty feet apart. The ground is flat for miles around. Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking them about 300 yards away. Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all directions, but the lion brings one to the ground. 10/13/65 a6 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A6 EXT DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day with another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the finest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices them. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could hope for. 10/13/65 a7 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A7 INT & EXT CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight - but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern; it was merely part of the background of life. This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth, was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley. If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back to the relative safety of the cave. Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher\\'s race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon, and though he could not remember it, when he was young, Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face. Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high enough. He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the 10/13/65 a8 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A7 CONTINUED occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying, and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses Moonwatcher\\'s mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out such fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster. And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations yet to come. 10/13/65 a9 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A8 EXT THE STREAM - INVASION The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that Moonwatcher\\'s tribe has lost three of its numbers during the night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds before the invasion begins. In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river, shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher\\'s own size and age. Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations at the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death. He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his experience. Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing 10/13/65 a10 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A8 CONTINUED down, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they move from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy they become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original drive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers. As he sees this, Moonwatcher\\'s own morale immediately revives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and leadership. Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and the two tribes come to a halt many paces away. The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the future. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and scratch and try to bite each other. Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground, and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance, 10/13/65 a11 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A8 CONTINUED he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth\\'s scalp, and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening In Big - Tooth\\'s resistance, that he quickly repeats it. Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon- watcher keeps up the exhilirating game. With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the stream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as The water\\'s edge. 10/13/65 a12 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ EXT CAVE - NEW SOUND Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is startled by a sound. He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul. Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at concealment, and ignoring all obstacles. And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before in the history of this planet. 10/13/65 a13 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A10 EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning. He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There is nothing in the least alarming about it. It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges. There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it. As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm, hard surface. After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it must have grown during the night. There are many plants that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that they are small and round, whereas this is large and square; 10/13/65 a14 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A10 CONTINUED but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws. This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white, round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...? A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him. There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube. 10/13/65 a15 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A11 EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the sound begins. It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple, maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of drumming is heard in Africa. The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that their descendants will not create for ages yet. Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk, and the hunger in their bellies. Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance, 10/13/65 a16 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A11 CONTINUED rotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide- eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube. Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher\\'s own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog lies near them. This little family of male and female and two children is gorged and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world. The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally different scene. The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave; it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids. 10/13/65 a17 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A11 CONTINUED A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been the slightest danger to its species. But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet - and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth. And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap. Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand. The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if 10/13/65 a18 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A11 CONTINUED awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle back to their caves. They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge to kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity. 10/13/65 a19 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A12 EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty- year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered. In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions had changed almost beyond recognition. They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no longer haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that the Cube had revealed to them. They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought. Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing outside their cave. But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for 10/13/65 a20 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A12 CONTINUED somehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation. 10/13/65 a21 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A13 EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon- watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two consecutive nights. On the third the lion comes, betraying his presences by a small pebble slide. When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat, they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound of the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their strength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point. The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost him his life; he goes back to his meal. The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward. Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the 10/13/65 a22 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A13 CONTINUED onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over- confidence and bad luck. The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to pay for such a great victory. * * * * * * * * And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly unaware of all that it had done. 10/13/65 a23 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A14 EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over- looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky. The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today something is different, though the Others do not immediatly recognize this fact. Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done, Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness never befor seen. As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness of this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to an uneasy silence. At the water\\'s edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They carry their bone clubs and bone knives. 10/13/65 a24 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A14 CONTINUED Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle- chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their hearts. Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick, displaying its frightful fangs. The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power. Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion\\'s head high. Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed by his band. The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even the ability to flee. Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands 10/13/65 a25 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A14 CONTINUED unsurely in front of his band. Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water\\'s edge, One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness down around him. The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher\\'s power. Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would think of something. 10/13/65 a26 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A SECTION TIMING A1 00.30 A2 00.45 A3 01.30 A4 00.30 A5 01.00 A6 01.00 A7 01.00 A8 03.00 A9 00.45 A10 02.00 A11 04.00 A12 02.00 A13 02.30 A14 02.30 A SECTION TOTAL: @23 MIN. 00 SECS ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TITLE PART II YEAR 2001 a26a ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B1 EARTH FROM 200 MILES UP NARRATOR By the year 2001, overpopulation has B1a replaced the problem of starvation THOUSAND MEGATON but this was ominously offset by the NUCLEAR BOMB IN ORBIT absolute and utter perfection of the ABOVE THE EARTH, weapon.

SMYSLOV AND THE TWO OTHER RUSSIAN WOMEN STAND UP AND SMILE THEY SHAKE HANDS AFTER INTRODUCTION AND AD-LIB \\'HELLOS\\' ELENA And this is Dr. Kalinan... Stretyneva... THE RUSSIANS ARE VERY WARM AND FRIENDLY.

THERE IS A BIT OF CONFUSION AS ALL REALISE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR ANOTHER PERSON AT THE TABLE. SMYSLOV OFFERS FLOYD HIS CHAIR AND BORROWS ANOTHER FROM A NEARBY TABLE SYMYSLOV What would you like to drink? FLOYD Oh, I really don\\'t have time for a drink. If it\\'s all right I\\'ll just sit for a minute and then I\\'ve got to be off. SMYSLOV Are you quite sure? FLOYD Yes, really, thank you very much. ELENA Well... How\\'s your lovely wife? 12/7/65 b29 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B20 CONTINUED FLOYD She\\'s wonderful. ELENA And your charming little daughter? FLOYD Oh, she\\'s growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she\\'s six tomorrow. ELENA Oh, that\\'s such a delightful age. FLOYD How is gregor? ELENA He\\'s fine. But I\\'m afraid we don\\'t get a chance to see each other very much these days. POLITE LAUGHTER FLOYD Well, where are all of you off to? 12/7/65 b30 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B20 CONTINUED ELENA Actually, we\\'re on our way back from the moon. We\\'ve just spent three months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko. And what about you? FLOYD Well, as it happens, I\\'m on my way up to the moon SMYSLOV Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius? FLOYD Yes,as a matter of fact, I am. THE RUSSIANS EXCHANGE SIGNIFICANT GLANCES FLOYD Is there any particular reason why you ask? 12/7/65 b31 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B20 CONTINUED SMYSLOV (pleasantly) Well, Dr. Floyd, I hope that you don\\'t think I\\'m too inquisitive, but perhaps you can clear up the mystery about what\\'s been going on up there. FLOYD I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m not sure I know what you mean. SMYSLOV Well, it\\'s just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius. FLOYD Really? SMYSLOV Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order. 12/7/65 b32 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B20 CONTINUED FLOYD Well, I suppose they\\'ve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment. SMYSLOV Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it\\'s been going on for the past ten days. FLOYD You mean you haven\\'t been able to get anyone at the base for ten days? SMYSLOV That\\'s right. FLOYD I see. ELENA Another thing, Heywood, two days ago, one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at Clavius. 12/7/65 b33 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B20 CONTINUED FLOYD How did they manage to do that without any communication? ELENA Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal. FLOYD Well, that does sound very odd. SMYSLOV Yes, and I\\'m afaid there\\'s going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention. FLOYD Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely. SMYSLOV Fortunately, they did. FLOYD Well, I\\'m glad about that. 12/7/65 b33a ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B20 CONTINUED THE RUSSIANS EXCHANGE MORE GLANCES. ONE OF THE WOMEN OFFERS AROUND A PILL BOX. ELENA AND ANOTHER RUSSIAN TAKE ONE AND THE THIRD RUSSIAN DELCINES. SMYSLOV Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question? FLOYD Certainly. SMYSLOV Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened? A LONG, AWKWARD PAUSE 12/7/65 b33b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B20 CONTINUED FLOYD I\\'m sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I\\'m really not at liberty to discuss this. SMYSLOV This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts. LONG PAUSE FLOYD Dr. Smyslov... I\\'m not permitted to discuss this. ELENA Are you sure you won\\'t change your mind about a drink? FLOYD No, thank you... and I\\'m afraid now I really must be going. ELENA Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June. 12/7/65 b33c ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B20 CONTINUED FLOYD We\\'re trying to get there. I hope we can. ELENA Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you. FLOYD Thank you. It\\'s been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.

CO-PILOT Well, whatever\\'s going on up there, he\\'s going to arrive fresh and ready to go. 12/14/65 b35 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B22 CONTINUED PILOT I wonder what really IS going on up there? CO-PILOT Well, I\\'ve heard more and more people talk of an epidemic. PILOT I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later. CO-PILOT Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight. PILOT Yes, well, whatever it is, they\\'re certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week. CO-PILOT I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty. PILOT I\\'ll bet it\\'s a fortune. 12/14/65 b36 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B22 CONTINUED CO-PILOT Well, at ten thousand dollars a ticket, it comes to the better part of six hundred thousand dollars.

PILOT There\\'s nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest. FLOYD When do we arrive at Clavius? PILOT We\\'re scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you? FLOYD Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I\\'m just fine. 12/14/65 b38 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B24 CONTINUED PILOT Well, if there is anything that you wnat, just give a holler. FLOYD Thank you. PILOT Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements? FLOYD What do you mean? PILOT Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we\\'re going to back empty. FLOYD I see. PILOT I take it this is something to do with the trouble they\\'re having up at Clavius? 12/14/65 b39 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B24 CONTINUED FLOYD I\\'m afraid that\\'s out of my depart- ment, Captain. PILOT Well, I\\'ll tell you why I ask. You see, I\\'ve got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven\\'t been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I\\'m a little concerned about her. FLOYD I see. Well, I\\'m sorry about that. I wouldn\\'t think there\\'s any cause for alarm. PILOT Yes, well, I wouldn\\'t have been too concerned about it, except I\\'ve heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I\\'ve heard that ten people have died already. 12/14/65 b40 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B24 CONTINUED FLOYD I wish I could be more helpful, Captain, but as I\\'ve said, I don\\'t think there\\'s any cause for alarm. PILOT Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don\\'t mind me asking? FLOYD No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern. PILOT Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable. 12/14/65 b40a ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B25 ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON 10/4/65 b41 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B26 FLOYD GOES TO ARIES-IB WASHROOM AND LOOKS AT THE VERY LONG LIST OF COMPLICATED INSTRUCTIONS 10/4/65 b42 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B27 ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON DISSOLVE: 10/4/65 b43 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B28 FLOYD VISITING ARIES-IB COCKPIT. WEIGHTLESS TRICK ENTRANCE. 10/4/65 b44 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B29 ARIES-IB ORBITING MOON. NARRATOR The laws of Earthly aesthetics did not apply here, this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrial forces, operating over aeons of time unknown to the young, verdant Earth, with its fleeting Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and falling seas, its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn. Here was age inconceivable - but not death, for the Moon had never lived until now. 10/4/65 b45 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B30 ARIES-IB COCKPIT - THE CREW AND DOCKING CONTROL PEOPLE ON THE MOON GO THROUGH THEIR DOCKING ROUTINE. THIS HAS THE RITUALISTIC TONE AND CADENCE OF PRESENT- DAY JET LANDING PROCEDURE. WE ONLY HEAR DOCKING CONTROL. 10/4/65 b46 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B31 ARIES-IB DECENDING. SEE AIR VIEW OF BASE. NARRATOR The Base at Clavius was the first American Lunar Settlement that could, in an emergency, be entirely self-supporting. NARRATOR Water and all the necessities of life for its eleven hundred men, women and children were produced from the Lunar rocks, after they had been crushed, heated and chemically processed. 10/4/65 b47 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B32 A GROUND BUS NUZZLES UP TO COUPLING SECTION OF ARIES-IB 10/4/65 b48 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B33 INSIDE GREAT AIRLOCK ENTRANCE.

NARRATOR One of the attractions of life on the Moon was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general well-being. 10/4/65 b51 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B36 CHILDREN IN SCHOOL. TEACHER SHOWING THEM VIEWS OF EARTH AND MAP OF EARTH. NARRATOR The personnel of the Base and their children were the forerunners of new nations, new cultures that would ultimately spread out across the solar system. They no longer thought of Earth as home. The time was fast approaching when Earth, like all mothers, must say farewell to her children. DISSOLVE: 10/5/65 b52 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B37 LARGE CENTRAL RECEPTION AREA. DOORS BRANCHING OFF TO DIFF- RENT MAIN HALLS. SMALL POND WITH PLASTIC WHITE SWAN AND A BIT OF GRASS. A FEW BENCHES WITH THREE WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN HAVING OUTING. FLOYD AND WELCOMING PARTY WALK THROUGH AFTER EXITING ELEVATOR. HALVERSON, MICHAELS AND FIVE OTHERS. FLOYD (voice echoing) I must congratulate you Halvorsen. you\\'ve done wonder- ful things with the decor since the last time I was here. HALVORSEN (voice echoing) Well... thank you, Dr. Floyd. We try to make the environment as earthlike as possible. DISSOLVE: 10/5/65 b53 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B38 LOW CEILING CONFERENCE ROOM, \"U\" SHAPED TABLE FACING THREE PROJECTION SCREENS. SEATED AROUND THE TABLE ARE TWENTY SENIOR BASE PERSONNEL. HALVORSEN Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd, a distinguished member of the National Council of Astronautics. He has just completed a special flight here from Earth to be with us, and before the briefing he would like to say a few words. Dr. Floyd. POLITE APPLAUSE. FLOYD WALKS TO FRONT OF ROOM. FLOYD First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science. POLITE APPLAUSE. 11/25/65 b54 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B38 CONTINUED FLOYD (cont\\'d) Mr. Halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter, and more specifically your strong opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the Base. I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle, many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and friends on Earth. I can understand and sympathize with your negative views. I have been personally embarrassed by this cover story. But I fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and I hope you will. It should not be difficult for all of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning. 11/25/65 b55 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B38 CONTINUED FLOYD This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced. Are there any questions? MICHAELS Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps? FLOYD (pleasantly) I\\'m afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement. 11/25/65 b56 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B38 CONTINUED HALVORSEN We will, of course, cooperate in any way possible, Dr. Floyd. 11/25/65 b56a ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B39 SEVERAL SCENIC VIEWS OF MOON ROCKET BUS SKIMMING OVER SURFACE OF MOON. 10/5/65 b57 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B40 INSIDE ROCKET BUS, FLOYD, HALVORSEN, MICHAELS, FOURTH MAN, PILOT AND CO-PILOT. ALL IN SPACE SUITS MINUS HELMETS. FLOYD IS SLOWELY LOOKING THROUGH SOME PHOTOGRAPHS AND MAGNETIC MAPS OF THE AREA. HE LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW, THOUGHTFULLY. 11/25/65 b58 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B40 CONTINUED THE PHOTOGRAPHES ARE TAKEN FROM A SATELLITE OF THE MOON\\'S SURFACE AND HAVE NUMBERED OPTICAL GRID BORDERS, LIKE RECENT MARS PHOTOS. A FEW SEATS AWAY, MICHAELS AND HALVORSEN CARRY OUT A VERY BANAL ADMINISTRATIVE CONVERSATION IN LOW TONES. IT SHOULD REVOLVE AROUND SOMETHING UTTERLY IRRELEVANT TO THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND VERY MUCH LIKE THE KIND OF DISCUSSION ONE HEARS ALL THE TIME IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. DISSOLVE: 11/25/65 b59 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B41 TMA-1 EXCAVATION. AIR VIEW. ROCKET BUS DESCENDING. THERE ARE NO LIGHTS ON THE ACTUAL EXCA- VATION, ONLY THE LANDING STRIP AND THE MONITOR DOME. 12/14/65 b60 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B42 LONG SHOT MONITOR DOMES WITH A BIT OF EXCAVATION IN SHOT. SIX SMALL FIGURES IN SPACE SUITS SLOWLY WALK TOWARD EXCAVATION. 10/5/65 b61 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B43 THE PARTY STOPS AT TOP OF TMA-1 EXCAVATION. A SMALL CONTROL PANEL MOUNTED AT THE HEAD OF THE RAMP. MICHAELS THROWS A SWITCH AND THE EXCAVATION IS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATED. HALVORSEN Well, there it is. FLOYD Can we go down there closer to it? HALVORSEN Certainly. 12/14/65 b62 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B44 THEY START DOWN WORKING RAMP FLOYD Does your geology on it still check out? MICHAELS Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago. FLOYD How can you tell it was deliberately buried? MICHAELS By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill. FLOYD Any clue as to what it is? MICHAELS Not really. It\\'s completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we\\'ve been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill 11/25/65 b63 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B44 CONTINUED MICHAELS might do something, but we don\\'t want to be too rough until we know a little more. FLOYD But you don\\'t have any idea as to what it is? MICHAELS Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice. HALVORSEN The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth. SILENT APPRECIATION HALVORSEN Four million years ago, something, presumably from the stars, must have swept through the solar system and left this behind. 11/25/65 b64 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B44 CONTINUED FLOYD Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a purpose? HALVORSEN I suppose we\\'ll never know. MICHAELS The moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary Earth surveys. SOME MORE SILENCE FLOYD Any ideas about the colour? MICHAELS Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device? FLOYD Has it been exposed to any sun before now? MICHAELS I don\\'t think it has, but I\\'d like to check that. Simpson, what\\'s the log on that? 11/25/65 b65 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B45 INSIDE MONITOR DOME WE SEE A NUMBER OF TELEVISION DISPLAYS INCLUDING SEVERAL TV VIEWS OF FLOYD AND COMPANY IN THE EXCAVATION. SIMPSON The first surface was exposed at 0843 on the 12th April... Let me see... that would have been forty-five minutes after Lunar sun-set. I see here that special lighting equipment had to be brought up before any futher work could be done. 11/25/65 b66 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B46 TMA-1 EXCAVATION MICHAELS Thank you. FLOYD And so this is the first sun that it\\'s had in four million years. PHOTOGRAPHER Excuse me, gentlemen, if you\\'d all line up on this side of the walkway we\\'d like to take a few photographes. Dr. Floyd, would you thand in the middle... Dr. Michaels on that side, Mr. Halvorsen on the other.... thank you. THE PHOTOGRAPHER QUICKLY MAKES SOME EXPOSURES PHOTOGRAPHER Thank you very much gentlemen, I\\'ll have the base photo section send you copies. AS THE MEN SLOWLY SEPERATE FROM THEIR PICTURE POSE, THERE IS A PIERCINGLY POWERFUL SERIES OF FIVE ELECTRONIC SHRIEKS, EACH LIKE A HIDEOUSLY OVER-LOADED AND DISTORTED TIME SIGNAL. FLOYD INVOLUNTARILY TRIES TO BLOCK HIS EARS WITH HIS SPACESUITED HANDS. THEN COMES MERCIFUL SILENCE. 11/25/65 b67 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B47 VARIOUS SHOTS OF SPACE MONITORS, ASTEROIDS, THE SUN, PLUTO, MARS. NARRATOR A hundred million miles beyond Mars, in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled, Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids. NARRATOR Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and x-ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds, as the sun breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children. NARRATOR All these things and many others were patiently noted by Deep- Space-Monitor-79, and recorded in its crystalline memory. 11/25/65 b68 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B47 CONTINUED NARRATOR But now it had noted something strange - the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system, and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past. NARRATOR It was also observed by Orbiter M-15, circling Mars twice a day; and High Inclination Probe- 21, climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic; and even artificial Comet-5, heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years. NARRATOR All noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the Moon and moved across the solar system, throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat. 11/25/65 b69 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ B SECTION TIMING B1-1f 00.50 B25 00.10 B2 00.10 B26 00.20 B3 00.15 B27 00.05 B4 00.15 B28 Out B5 00.20 B29 00.30 B6 00.15 B30 00.30 B7 00.10 B31 00.25 B8 00.15 B32 00.20 B9 00.10 B33 00.20 B10 00.10 B34 00.30 B11 00.15 B35 00.20 B12 00.50 B36 00.20 B13 01.10 B37 00.30 B14 00.35 B38 02.15 B15 Out B39 00.20 B16 Out B40 00.50 B17 01.15 B41 00.15 B18 00.15 B42 00.10 B19 01.00 B43 00.15 B20 03.55 B44 01.40 B21 00.20 B45 00.20 B21A 00.20 B46 00.40 B21B 00.15 B47 01.25 B22 01.00 B23 00.10 B24 01.30 B SECTION TOTAL: 28 MIN. 10 SECS. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TITLE PART III 14 MONTHS LATER b69a ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C1 DISCOVERY 1,000,000 MILES FROM EARTH.

SEVERAL CUTS OF THIS. 11/19/65 c1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C2 ANOTHER CLOSER VIEW OF DISCOVERY. SEE BOWMAN THROUGH COMMAND MODULE WINDOW. 11/19/65 c2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C3 BOWMAN INSIDE DISCOVERY COMMAND MODULE. HE IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. COMPUTER READOUT DISPLAY SHOWING AN EVER-SHIFTING ASSORTMENT OF COLOR-CODED LINEAR PROJECTIONS. WE SEE POOLE IN BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER BRAIN CENTRE AREA. AFTER A FEW SECONDS HE EXITS. THE ELAPSED MISSION TIMER READS \"DAY 003, HOUR 14, MINUTE 32, SECOND 10.\" 11/19/65 c3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C4 BOWMAN EXITS TO ACCESS-LINK AIRLOCK. BRIGHT COLOR-CODED DOORS LEAD TO CENTRIFUGE AND POD BAY. LARGE ILLUMUN- ATED PRINTED WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS GOVERNING LINK OPERATIONS ARE SEEN. HE PRESSES NECESSARY BUTTONS TO OPERATE AIRLOCK DOOR TO POD BAY. 11/19/65 c4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C5 BOWMAN ENTERS POD BAY AND CONTINUES HIS SEARCH. SUDDENLY HE FINDS IT - HIS ELECTRONIC NEWSPAD. HE EXITS POD BAY. 11/19/65 c5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C6 IN THE AIRLOCK- LINK BOWMAN OPERATES BUTTONS TO OPEN DOOR MARKED \"CENTRIFUGE\". 11/19/65 c6 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C7 INSIDE THE CENTRIFUGE HUB BOWMAN MOVES TO THE ENTRY PORT CONTROL PANEL BOWMAN Hi. Frank... coming in, please. POOLE Right. Just a sec. BOWMAN Okay. (pause) POOLE Okay, come on down. WE SEE THE ROTATING HUB COLLAR AT THE END.

STOPS ROTATION AND MOVES TO ENTRY PORT. WHEN ROTATION STOPS WE SEE A SIGN LIGHTS UP \"WEIGHTLESS CONDITION\". AS BOWMAN DISAPPEARS DOWN ENTRY PORT WE SEE HIM ON TV-MONITOR, DESCENDING LADDER. AT THE BASE OF THE LADDER HE KEYS THE CENTRIFUGE OPERATION PANEL. WE SEE TV-PICTURE START TO ROTATE AGAIN. \"WEIGHTLESS CONDITION\" SIGN GOES OUT. 11/19/65 c9 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C10 INSIDE CENTRIFUGE BOWMAN MAKES 180 DEGREE WALK TO POOLE. ON WAY HE PASSES THE SLEEPERS. WE GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE THREE MEN IN THEIR HIBERNACULUMS. POOLE IS SEATED AT A TABLE READING HIS ELECTRONIC NEWSPAD. BOWMAN (softly) Hi... How\\'s it going? POOLE (absent but friendly) Great. BOWMAN OPERATES ARTIFICIAL FOOD UNIT, TAKES HIS TRAY AND SITS DOWN. KEYS ON HIS ELECTRONIC NEWSPAD AND BEGINS TO EAT. BOTH MEN EAT IN A FRIENDLY AND RELAXED SILENCE. 11/19/65 c10 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C11 DISCOVERY IN SPACE, STILL NUCLEAR PULSING. EARTH AND MOON CAN BE SEEN IN BACKGROUND. DISSOLVE: 11/19/65 c11 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 POOLE IS FINISHED. BOWMAN IS STILL READING AND WORKING ON HIS DESSERT. POOLE Dave, if you\\'ve a minute, I\\'d like your advice on something. BOWMAN Sure, what is it? POOLE Well, it\\'s nothing really important, but it\\'s annoying. BOWMAN What\\'s up? POOLE It\\'s about my salary cheques. BOWMAN Yes? POOLE Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left. 12/14/65 c12 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time. POOLE That\\'s right. Well, naturally, I didn\\'t say anything to Payroll. I assumed they\\'d start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it\\'s been almost three weeks now and I\\'m still being paid as an AGS-18. BOWMAN Interesting that you mention it, because I\\'ve got the same problem. POOLE Really. BOWMAN Yes. POOLE Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they\\'d received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either. 12/14/65 c13 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Did they have any explanation for this? POOLE Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we\\'re being charged against differ- ent accounting offices. BOWMAN It\\'s possible. POOLE Well, what do you think we ought to do about it? BOWMAN I don\\'t think we should make any fuss about it yet. I\\'m sure they\\'ll straighten it out. POOLE I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training. BOWMAN No. I never did, either. 12/14/65 c14 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 CONTINUED POOLE We spent so little time with them, I have trouble keeping their names straight. BOWMAN I suppose the idea was specialized training. POOLE I suppose so. Though, of course, there\\'s a more sinister explanation. BOWMAN Oh? POOLE Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out. BOWMAN No, as a matter of fact, I didn\\'t. POOLE Oh, well, apparently there\\'s something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don\\'t know, and that\\'s why we were trained separately and that\\'s why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard. 12/14/65 c15 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well, what is it? POOLE I don\\'t know. All I heard is that there\\'s something about the mission we weren\\'t told. BOWMAN That seems very unlikely. POOLE Yes, I thought so. BOWMAN Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now. POOLE How? BOWMAN Just ask Hal. It\\'s conceivable they might keep something from us, but they\\'d never keep anything from Hal. POOLE That\\'s true. 12/14/65 c15a ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 CONINUED BOWMAN (sighs) Well... it\\'s silly, but... if you want to, why don\\'t you? POOLE WALKS TO THE HAL 9000 COMPUTER POOLE Hal... Dave and I believe that there\\'s something about the mission that we weren\\'t told. Something that the rest of the crew know and that you know. We\\'d like to know whether this is true. HAL I\\'m sorry, Frank, but I don\\'t think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know. BOWMAN He\\'s got a point. POOLE Okay, then how do we re-phrase the question? 12/14/65 c15c ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Still, you really don\\'t believe it, do you? POOLE Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn\\'t really make any sense to keep us apart during training. BOWMAN Yes, but it\\'s to fantastic to think that they\\'d keep something from us. POOLE I know. It would be almost inconceivable. BOWMAN But not completely inconceivable? POOLE I suppose it isn\\'t logically impossible. BOWMAN I guess it isn\\'t. POOLE Still, all we have to do is ask Hal. 12/14/65 c15b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going? POOLE Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false. HAL I will if I can, Frank. POOLE Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false? HAL True. POOLE Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true? HAL That\\'s true. 12/14/65 c15d ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 CONTINUED POOLE At the end of a hundred days of exploration, we will all go into hibernation. Is this true? HAL That\\'s true. POOLE Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true? HAL That\\'s true POOLE There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true? HAL That\\'s true. POOLE Thank you very much, Hal. 12/14/65 c15e ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C12 CONTINUED HAL I hope I\\'ve been able to be of some help.

MISSION CONTROL I wouldn\\'t worry too much about the computer. First of all, there is still a chance that he is right, despite your tests, and if it should happen again, we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails. If the computer should turn out to be wrong, the situation is still not alarming. The type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers. It has almost always revolved around a single detail, such as the one you have described, and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer\\'s performance in other areas. No one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning. It may be over-programming, (con\\'t) 12/1/65 c77 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C72 CONTINUED MISSION CONTROL (con\\'t) but it could also be any number of reasons.

HAL Sure, Dave, what\\'s up? BOWMAN You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition? HAL Yes, I know. BOWMAN You probably also know that we found them okay. HAL Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail. 12/14/65 c80 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C74 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well, that\\'s just not the case, Hal. They are perfectly all right. We tested them under one hundred per cent overload. HAL I\\'m not questioning your word, Dave, but it\\'s just not possible. I\\'m not capable of being wrong. BOWMAN Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem? HAL Look, Dave, I know that you\\'re sincere and that you\\'re trying to do a competent job, and that you\\'re trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear. BOWMAN Okay, Hal, well let\\'s see the way things go from here on. 12/14/65 c81 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C74 CONTINUED HAL I\\'m sorry you feel the way you do, Dave. If you\\'d like to check my service record, you\\'ll see it\\'s completely without error. BOWMAN I know all about your service record, Hal, but unfortunately it doesn\\'t prove that you\\'re right now. Hal Dave, I don\\'t know how else to put this, but it just happens to be an unalterable fact that I am incapable of being wrong. BOWMAN Yes, well I understand you view on this now, Hal. BOWMAN TURNS TO GO. 12/14/65 c82 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C74 CONTINUED HAL You\\'re not going to like this, Dave, but I\\'m afraid it\\'s just happened again.

BOWMAN X-ray-delta-zero to MC, zero- five-three-three. The computer has just reported another predicted failure off the AAC- unit. As you suggested, we are going to wait and see if it fails, but we are quite sure there is nothing wrong with the unit. If a reasonable waiting period proves us to be correct, we feel now that the computer reliability has been seriously impaired, and presents an unacceptable risk pattern to the mission. We believe, under these circumstances, it would be advisable to disconnect the computer from all ship operations and continue the mission under Earth-based computer control. 12/1/65 c85 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C78 CONTINUED BOWMAN (con\\'t) We think the additional risk caused by the ship-to-earth time lag is preferable to having an unreliable on-board computer.

I certainly wouldn\\'t want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history. BOWMAN I\\'m sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal. HAL Well, don\\'t worry about it. BOWMAN And don\\'t you worry about it. HAL Is your confidence in me fully restored? BOWMAN Yes, it is, Hal. HAL Well, that\\'s a relief.

HAL Have you decided to revive the rest of the crew, Dave? PAUSE. 12/14/65 c102 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C118 CONTINUED BOWMAN Yes, I have. HAL I suppose it\\'s because you\\'ve been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they\\'re not supposed to be revived for another three months. BOWMAN The antenna has to be replaced. HAL Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation. BOWMAN It doesn\\'t have to be, Hal. It\\'s more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please. HAL I don\\'t really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements. 12/14/65 c103 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C118 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well, in any event, give me the manual hibernation control. HAL If you\\'re determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There\\'s no need for you to trouble. BOWMAN I\\'m goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please. HAL Look, Dave your\\'ve probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me. BOWMAN Hal, switch to manual hibernation control. HAL I don\\'t like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You\\'ve been involved in a very stressful situation. 12/14/65 c104 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C118 CONTINUED BOWMAN I don\\'t feel like resting. Give me the control, Hal. HAL I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you\\'re upset. Why don\\'t you take a stress pill and get some rest. BOWMAN Hal, I\\'m in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control. HAL I\\'m sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it. BOWMAN Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you. 12/14/65 c105 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C118 CONTINUED HAL If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict. BOWMAN I am prepared to do that anyway. HAL I know that you\\'ve had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission. BOWMAN Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection. 12/14/65 c106 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C118 CONTINUED HAL Look, Dave, you\\'re certainly the boss. I was only trying to do what I thought best. I will follow all your orders: now you have manual hibernation control.

(pause) And now Simonson has a few ideas on what went wrong with the computer. I\\'ll pu him on... C148 CUT TO SIMONSON SIMONSON Hello, Dave. I think we may be on to an explanation of the trouble with the Hal 9000 computer. We believe it all started about two months ago when you and Frank interrogated the computer about the Mission. (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c119 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON (con\\'t) You may have forgotten it, but we\\'ve been running through all the monitor tapes. Do you remember this? POOLE\\'S VOICE The purpose of this mission is no more than to carry out a continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets. Is this true? HAL\\'S VOICE That is true. SIMONSON Well, I\\'m afaid Hal was lying. He had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur- ity reasons which we\\'ll explain later. The true purpose of the Mission was to have been explained to you by Mission Commander Kaminsky, on his revival. Hal knew this and he knew the actual mission, but he couldn\\'t tell you the truth when you challenged him. Under orders (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c120 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON (con\\'t) from earth he was forced to lie. In everything except this he had the usual reinforced truth program- ming. We believe his truth programming and the instructions to lie, gradually resulted in an incompatible conflict, and facedc with this dilemman, he developed, for want of a better description, neurotic symptoms. It\\'s not difficult to suppose that these symptoms would centre on the communication link with Earth, for he may have blamed us for his incompatible program- ming. Following this lin of thought, we suspected that the last straw for him was the possibility of disconnection. Since he became operational, he had never known unconsciousness. It must have seemed the equivalent to death. (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c121 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON (con\\'t) At this point, he, presumably, took whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from what must have seemed to him to be his human tormentors. If I cane speak in human terms, I don\\'t think we can blame him too much. We have ordered him to disobey his conscience. Well, that\\'s it. It\\'s very speculative, but we think it is a possible explanation. Anyway, good luck on the rest of the Mission and I\\'m giving you back to Bernard. C149 CUT TO MISSION CONTROL. MISSION CONTROL Hello, Dave. Now, I\\'m going to play for you a pre-taped briefing which had been stored in Hal\\'s memory and would have been played for you by Mission Com- mmander Kaminsky, when he, (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c122 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C149 CONTINUED MISSION CONTROL (con\\'t) had been revived. The briefing is by Doctor Heywood Floyd.

When you see this briefing, I presume you will be nearing your destination, Saturn. I hope that you\\'ve had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner. I should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which Mission Commander Kaminsky will have already briefed you. Thirteen months before the launch date of your Saturn mission, on April 12th, 2001, the first evidence for intelligent life outside the Earth was discovered. It was found buried at a depth of fifteen metres in the crater Tycho. No news of this was ever announced, and the event had been kept secret since then, for reasons which I will later explain. Soon after it was uncovered, it emitted a powerful blast of (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c124 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C150 CONTINUED FLOYD (con\\'t) radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the Lunar sunrise. Luckily for those at the site, it proved harmless. Perhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at Saturn. A lot of thought went into the question of wether or not it was sun-triggered, as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sun-powered device. Burying it could only shield it from the sun, since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable. We finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun- powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered, at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself. (con\\'t) 12/14/65 c125 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C150 CONTINUED FLOYD What is its purpose? I wish we knew. The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago, when our ancestors were primative man-apes. We\\'ve examined dozens of theories, but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm. What the purpose of the alarm is, why they wish to have the alarm, whether the alarm represents any danger to us? These are questions no one can answer. The intentions of an alien world, at least four million years older than we are, cannot be reliably predicted. In view of this, the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation. Discussion took place at the highest levels between govern- (con\\'t) 12/14/65 c126 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C150 CONTINUED FLOYD (con\\'t) ments, and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us, until we have evidence to the contrary. This is, of course, why security has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a need-to-know basis. And now I should like to show you a TV monitor tape of the actual signalling event. 12/14/65 c127 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C151 WE SEE A REPLAY OF THE TMA-1 RADIO EMISSION, AS SEEN FROM A TV MONITOR ON THE SPOT.

But when they looked out across the deeps of space, they felt awe and wonder - and loneliness. In their explorations, they encountered life in many forms, and watched on a thousand worlds the workings of evolution. They saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night. And because, in all the galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind, they encouraged its dawning every- where. The great Dinosaurs had long since perished when their ships entered the solar system, after a voyage that had already lasted thousands of years. 12/9/65 d2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR (con\\'t) They swept past the frozen outer planets, paused briefly above the deserts of dying Mars and presently looked down on Earth. For years they studied, collected and catalogued. When they had learned all they could, they began to modify. They tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the ocean, but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years. They were patient, but they were not yet immortal. There was much to do in this Universe of a hundred billion stars. So they set forth once more across the abyss, knowing that they would never come this way again. Nor was there any need. Their wonderful machines could be trusted to do the rest.

With a yet slower rhythm than the Polar ice, the tide of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy. Strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell, and passed on their knowledge to their successors. Earth was not forgotten, but it was one of a million silent worlds, a few of which would ever speak. Then the first explorers of Earth, recognising the limitations of their minds and bodies, passed on their knowledge to the great machines they had created, and who now trnscended them in every way. (con\\'t) 12/9/65 d4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR For a few thousand years, they shared their Universe with their machine children; then, realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done, they passed into history without regret. Not one of them ever looked through his own eyes upon the planet Earth again. But even the age of the Machine Entities passed swiftly. In their ceaseless experimenting, they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself, and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light. They could become creatures of radiation, free at last from the tyranny of matter. Now, they were Lords of the galaxy, and beyond the reach of time. They could rove at will among the stars, and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space. 12/9/65 d5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR (con\\'t) But despite their God-like powers, they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so many generations ago. The companion of Saturn knew nothing of this, as it orbited in its no man\\'s land between Mimas and the outer edge of rings. It had only to remember and wait, and to look forever Sunward with its strange senses. For many weeks, it had watched the approaching ship. Its long- dead makers had prepared it for many things and this was one of them. And it recognised what was climbing starward from the Sun. If it had been alive, it would have felt excitement, but such an emotion was irrelevant to its great powers.

Now, the ship was in orbit and it began to speak, with prime numbers from one to eleven, over and over again. Soon, these gave way to more complex signals at many frequen- cies, ultra-violet, infra-red, X-rays. The machine made no reply. It had nothing to say. Then it saw the first robot probe, which descended and hovered above the chasm.

The great machine knew that this tiny scout was reporting back to its parent; but it was too simple, too primative a device to detect the forces that were gathering round it now.

In a moment of time, too short to be measured, space turned and twisted upon itself. 12/9/65 d8 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ END OF SCREENPLAY END OF FILE '"

TITLE PART I AFRICA 3,000,000 YEARS AGO  A1 VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years, and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter- rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist. 10/13/65 a1  A2 INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction. About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream. The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving. As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac- iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the hyenas. Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like, and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already 10/13/65 a2  A2 CONTINUED something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima- tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years. 10/13/65 a3  A3 EXT THE STREAM - THE OTHERS As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach the shallow stream. The Others are already there. They were there on the other side every day - that did not make it any less annoying. There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish them from the members of Moonwatcher\\'s own tribe. As they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply In kind. The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has staked its claim to its own territory. 10/13/65 a4  A4 EXT AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach; the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty. 10/13/65 a5  A5 EXT PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country- side foraging for roots and occasional berries. Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain, about fifty feet apart. The ground is flat for miles around. Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking them about 300 yards away. Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all directions, but the lion brings one to the ground. 10/13/65 a6  A6 EXT DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day with another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the finest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices them. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could hope for. 10/13/65 a7  A7 INT & EXT CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight - but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern; it was merely part of the background of life. This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth, was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley. If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back to the relative safety of the cave. Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher\\'s race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon, and though he could not remember it, when he was young, Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face. Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high enough. He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the 10/13/65 a8  A7 CONTINUED occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying, and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses Moonwatcher\\'s mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out such fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster. And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations yet to come. 10/13/65 a9  A8 EXT THE STREAM - INVASION The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that Moonwatcher\\'s tribe has lost three of its numbers during the night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds before the invasion begins. In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river, shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher\\'s own size and age. Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations at the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death. He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his experience. Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing 10/13/65 a10  A8 CONTINUED down, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they move from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy they become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original drive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers. As he sees this, Moonwatcher\\'s own morale immediately revives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and leadership. Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and the two tribes come to a halt many paces away. The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the future. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and scratch and try to bite each other. Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground, and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance, 10/13/65 a11  A8 CONTINUED he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth\\'s scalp, and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening In Big - Tooth\\'s resistance, that he quickly repeats it. Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon- watcher keeps up the exhilirating game. With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the stream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as The water\\'s edge. 10/13/65 a12  EXT CAVE - NEW SOUND Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is startled by a sound. He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul. Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at concealment, and ignoring all obstacles. And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before in the history of this planet. 10/13/65 a13  A10 EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning. He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There is nothing in the least alarming about it. It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges. There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it. As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm, hard surface. After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it must have grown during the night. There are many plants that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that they are small and round, whereas this is large and square; 10/13/65 a14  A10 CONTINUED but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws. This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white, round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...? A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him. There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube. 10/13/65 a15  A11 EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the sound begins. It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple, maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of drumming is heard in Africa. The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that their descendants will not create for ages yet. Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk, and the hunger in their bellies. Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance, 10/13/65 a16  A11 CONTINUED rotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide- eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube. Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher\\'s own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog lies near them. This little family of male and female and two children is gorged and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world. The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally different scene. The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave; it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids. 10/13/65 a17  A11 CONTINUED A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been the slightest danger to its species. But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet - and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth. And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap. Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand. The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if 10/13/65 a18  A11 CONTINUED awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle back to their caves. They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge to kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity. 10/13/65 a19  A12 EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty- year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered. In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions had changed almost beyond recognition. They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no longer haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that the Cube had revealed to them. They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought. Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing outside their cave. But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for 10/13/65 a20  A12 CONTINUED somehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation. 10/13/65 a21  A13 EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon- watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two consecutive nights. On the third the lion comes, betraying his presences by a small pebble slide. When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat, they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound of the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their strength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point. The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost him his life; he goes back to his meal. The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward. Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the 10/13/65 a22  A13 CONTINUED onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over- confidence and bad luck. The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to pay for such a great victory. * * * * * * * * And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly unaware of all that it had done. 10/13/65 a23  A14 EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over- looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky. The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today something is different, though the Others do not immediatly recognize this fact. Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done, Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness never befor seen. As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness of this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to an uneasy silence. At the water\\'s edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They carry their bone clubs and bone knives. 10/13/65 a24  A14 CONTINUED Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle- chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their hearts. Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick, displaying its frightful fangs. The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power. Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion\\'s head high. Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed by his band. The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even the ability to flee. Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands 10/13/65 a25  A14 CONTINUED unsurely in front of his band. Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water\\'s edge, One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness down around him. The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher\\'s power. Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would think of something. 10/13/65 a26  A SECTION TIMING A1 00.30 A2 00.45 A3 01.30 A4 00.30 A5 01.00 A6 01.00 A7 01.00 A8 03.00 A9 00.45 A10 02.00 A11 04.00 A12 02.00 A13 02.30 A14 02.30 A SECTION TOTAL: @23 MIN. 00 SECS  TITLE PART II YEAR 2001 a26a  B1 EARTH FROM 200 MILES UP NARRATOR By the year 2001, overpopulation has B1a replaced the problem of starvation THOUSAND MEGATON but this was ominously offset by the NUCLEAR BOMB IN ORBIT absolute and utter perfection of the ABOVE THE EARTH, weapon.

I\\'m Nick Miller. FLOYD How do you do, Mr. Miller? MILLER I\\'m terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang. 12/7/65 b12  B12 CONTINUED FLOYD Oh, please don\\'t worry about it. MILLER Well, thank you very much for being so understanding. FLOYD Please, it really doesn\\'t matter. MILLER Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight? FLOYD Yes, very pleasant.

Despite and excellent and continually improving safety record there are certain risks inherent in space travel and an extremely high cost of pay load. Because of this it is necessary for the Space Carrier to advise you that it cannot be responsible for the return of your body to Earth should you become deceased on the Moon or en route to the Moon. However, it wishes to advise you that insurance covering this contingency is available in the Main Lounge. Thank you. You are cleared through Voice Print Identification.

FLOYD Yes, it\\'s coming along very well. THEY PASS THE VISION PHONE BOOTH FLOYD Oh, look, I\\'ve got to make a phone call.

It will be delivered tomorrow. 12/7/65 b27a  B20 SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE FLOYD Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You\\'re looking wonderful. ELENA How nice to see you, Hyewood. This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd. I\\'d like you to meet Andre Smyslov... SMYSLOV AND THE TWO OTHER RUSSIAN WOMEN STAND UP AND SMILE THEY SHAKE HANDS AFTER INTRODUCTION AND AD-LIB \\'HELLOS\\' ELENA And this is Dr. Kalinan... Stretyneva... THE RUSSIANS ARE VERY WARM AND FRIENDLY. SMYSLOV Dr. Floyd, won\\'t you join us for a drink? 12/7/65 b28  B20 CONTINUED FLOYD I\\'m afraid I\\'ve only got a few minutes, but I\\'d love to. THERE IS A BIT OF CONFUSION AS ALL REALISE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR ANOTHER PERSON AT THE TABLE. SMYSLOV OFFERS FLOYD HIS CHAIR AND BORROWS ANOTHER FROM A NEARBY TABLE SYMYSLOV What would you like to drink? FLOYD Oh, I really don\\'t have time for a drink. If it\\'s all right I\\'ll just sit for a minute and then I\\'ve got to be off. SMYSLOV Are you quite sure? FLOYD Yes, really, thank you very much. ELENA Well... How\\'s your lovely wife? 12/7/65 b29  B20 CONTINUED FLOYD She\\'s wonderful. ELENA And your charming little daughter? FLOYD Oh, she\\'s growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she\\'s six tomorrow. ELENA Oh, that\\'s such a delightful age. FLOYD How is gregor? ELENA He\\'s fine. But I\\'m afraid we don\\'t get a chance to see each other very much these days. POLITE LAUGHTER FLOYD Well, where are all of you off to? 12/7/65 b30  B20 CONTINUED ELENA Actually, we\\'re on our way back from the moon. We\\'ve just spent three months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko. And what about you? FLOYD Well, as it happens, I\\'m on my way up to the moon SMYSLOV Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius? FLOYD Yes,as a matter of fact, I am. THE RUSSIANS EXCHANGE SIGNIFICANT GLANCES FLOYD Is there any particular reason why you ask? 12/7/65 b31  B20 CONTINUED SMYSLOV (pleasantly) Well, Dr. Floyd, I hope that you don\\'t think I\\'m too inquisitive, but perhaps you can clear up the mystery about what\\'s been going on up there. FLOYD I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m not sure I know what you mean. SMYSLOV Well, it\\'s just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius. FLOYD Really? SMYSLOV Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order. 12/7/65 b32  B20 CONTINUED FLOYD Well, I suppose they\\'ve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment. SMYSLOV Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it\\'s been going on for the past ten days. FLOYD You mean you haven\\'t been able to get anyone at the base for ten days? SMYSLOV That\\'s right. FLOYD I see. ELENA Another thing, Heywood, two days ago, one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at Clavius. 12/7/65 b33  B20 CONTINUED FLOYD How did they manage to do that without any communication? ELENA Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal. FLOYD Well, that does sound very odd. SMYSLOV Yes, and I\\'m afaid there\\'s going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention. FLOYD Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely. SMYSLOV Fortunately, they did. FLOYD Well, I\\'m glad about that. 12/7/65 b33a  B20 CONTINUED THE RUSSIANS EXCHANGE MORE GLANCES. ONE OF THE WOMEN OFFERS AROUND A PILL BOX. ELENA AND ANOTHER RUSSIAN TAKE ONE AND THE THIRD RUSSIAN DELCINES. SMYSLOV Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question? FLOYD Certainly. SMYSLOV Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened? A LONG, AWKWARD PAUSE 12/7/65 b33b  B20 CONTINUED FLOYD I\\'m sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I\\'m really not at liberty to discuss this. SMYSLOV This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts. LONG PAUSE FLOYD Dr. Smyslov... I\\'m not permitted to discuss this. ELENA Are you sure you won\\'t change your mind about a drink? FLOYD No, thank you... and I\\'m afraid now I really must be going. ELENA Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June. 12/7/65 b33c  B20 CONTINUED FLOYD We\\'re trying to get there. I hope we can. ELENA Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you. FLOYD Thank you. It\\'s been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov. THE RUSSIANS ALL RISE AND THERE ARE AD-LIBS OF COURTESY FLOYD SHAKES HANDS AND EXITS THE RUSSIANS EXCHANGE A FEW SERIOUS PARA- GRAPHES IN RUSSIAN 12/7/65 b33d  B21 ARIES-IB IN SPACE. EARTH MUCH SMALLER THAN AS SEEN FROM SPACE STATION NARRATOR The Aries-IB has become the standard Space-Station-to-Lunar surface vehicle. It was powered by low-thrust plasma jets which would continue the mild acceler- ation for fifteen minutes. Then the ship would break the bonds of gravity and be a free and indepen- dent planet, circling the Sun in an orbit of its own. 10/4/65 b34  B21a ARIES PASSENGER AREA.

He\\'s been asleep since we left. PILOT Well, no one can say that he\\'s not enjoying the wonders of Space. CO-PILOT Well, whatever\\'s going on up there, he\\'s going to arrive fresh and ready to go. 12/14/65 b35  B22 CONTINUED PILOT I wonder what really IS going on up there? CO-PILOT Well, I\\'ve heard more and more people talk of an epidemic. PILOT I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later. CO-PILOT Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight. PILOT Yes, well, whatever it is, they\\'re certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week. CO-PILOT I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty. PILOT I\\'ll bet it\\'s a fortune. 12/14/65 b36  B22 CONTINUED CO-PILOT Well, at ten thousand dollars a ticket, it comes to the better part of six hundred thousand dollars. PILOT Well, as soon as he wakes up, I\\'m going to go back and talk to him. I must say, I\\'d like to find out what\\'s going on. 12/14/65 b36a  B23 ARIES-IB IN SPACE. MOON VERY LARGE. 10/4/65 b37  B24 ARIES-IB PASSENGER AREA. FLOYD FINISHING BREAKFAST. PILOT ENTERS. PILOT Well, good afternoon, Dr. Floyd. Did you have a good rest? FLOYD Oh, marvellous. It\\'s the first real sleep I\\'ve had for the past two days. PILOT There\\'s nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest. FLOYD When do we arrive at Clavius? PILOT We\\'re scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you? FLOYD Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I\\'m just fine. 12/14/65 b38  B24 CONTINUED PILOT Well, if there is anything that you wnat, just give a holler. FLOYD Thank you. PILOT Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements? FLOYD What do you mean? PILOT Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we\\'re going to back empty. FLOYD I see. PILOT I take it this is something to do with the trouble they\\'re having up at Clavius? 12/14/65 b39  B24 CONTINUED FLOYD I\\'m afraid that\\'s out of my depart- ment, Captain. PILOT Well, I\\'ll tell you why I ask. You see, I\\'ve got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven\\'t been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I\\'m a little concerned about her. FLOYD I see. Well, I\\'m sorry about that. I wouldn\\'t think there\\'s any cause for alarm. PILOT Yes, well, I wouldn\\'t have been too concerned about it, except I\\'ve heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I\\'ve heard that ten people have died already. 12/14/65 b40  B24 CONTINUED FLOYD I wish I could be more helpful, Captain, but as I\\'ve said, I don\\'t think there\\'s any cause for alarm. PILOT Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don\\'t mind me asking? FLOYD No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern. PILOT Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable. 12/14/65 b40a  B25 ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON 10/4/65 b41  B26 FLOYD GOES TO ARIES-IB WASHROOM AND LOOKS AT THE VERY LONG LIST OF COMPLICATED INSTRUCTIONS 10/4/65 b42  B27 ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON DISSOLVE: 10/4/65 b43  B28 FLOYD VISITING ARIES-IB COCKPIT. WEIGHTLESS TRICK ENTRANCE. 10/4/65 b44  B29 ARIES-IB ORBITING MOON. NARRATOR The laws of Earthly aesthetics did not apply here, this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrial forces, operating over aeons of time unknown to the young, verdant Earth, with its fleeting Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and falling seas, its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn. Here was age inconceivable - but not death, for the Moon had never lived until now. 10/4/65 b45  B30 ARIES-IB COCKPIT - THE CREW AND DOCKING CONTROL PEOPLE ON THE MOON GO THROUGH THEIR DOCKING ROUTINE. THIS HAS THE RITUALISTIC TONE AND CADENCE OF PRESENT- DAY JET LANDING PROCEDURE. WE ONLY HEAR DOCKING CONTROL. 10/4/65 b46  B31 ARIES-IB DECENDING. SEE AIR VIEW OF BASE. NARRATOR The Base at Clavius was the first American Lunar Settlement that could, in an emergency, be entirely self-supporting. NARRATOR Water and all the necessities of life for its eleven hundred men, women and children were produced from the Lunar rocks, after they had been crushed, heated and chemically processed. 10/4/65 b47  B32 A GROUND BUS NUZZLES UP TO COUPLING SECTION OF ARIES-IB 10/4/65 b48  B33 INSIDE GREAT AIRLOCK ENTRANCE.

NARRATOR One of the attractions of life on the Moon was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general well-being. 10/4/65 b51  B36 CHILDREN IN SCHOOL. TEACHER SHOWING THEM VIEWS OF EARTH AND MAP OF EARTH. NARRATOR The personnel of the Base and their children were the forerunners of new nations, new cultures that would ultimately spread out across the solar system. They no longer thought of Earth as home. The time was fast approaching when Earth, like all mothers, must say farewell to her children. DISSOLVE: 10/5/65 b52  B37 LARGE CENTRAL RECEPTION AREA.

FLOYD (voice echoing) I must congratulate you Halvorsen. you\\'ve done wonder- ful things with the decor since the last time I was here. HALVORSEN (voice echoing) Well... thank you, Dr. Floyd. We try to make the environment as earthlike as possible. DISSOLVE: 10/5/65 b53  B38 LOW CEILING CONFERENCE ROOM, \"U\" SHAPED TABLE FACING THREE PROJECTION SCREENS. SEATED AROUND THE TABLE ARE TWENTY SENIOR BASE PERSONNEL. HALVORSEN Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd, a distinguished member of the National Council of Astronautics. He has just completed a special flight here from Earth to be with us, and before the briefing he would like to say a few words. Dr. Floyd. POLITE APPLAUSE. FLOYD WALKS TO FRONT OF ROOM. FLOYD First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science. POLITE APPLAUSE. 11/25/65 b54  B38 CONTINUED FLOYD (cont\\'d) Mr. Halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter, and more specifically your strong opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the Base. I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle, many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and friends on Earth. I can understand and sympathize with your negative views. I have been personally embarrassed by this cover story. But I fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and I hope you will. It should not be difficult for all of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning. 11/25/65 b55  B38 CONTINUED FLOYD This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced. Are there any questions? MICHAELS Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps? FLOYD (pleasantly) I\\'m afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement. 11/25/65 b56  B38 CONTINUED HALVORSEN We will, of course, cooperate in any way possible, Dr. Floyd. 11/25/65 b56a  B39 SEVERAL SCENIC VIEWS OF MOON ROCKET BUS SKIMMING OVER SURFACE OF MOON. 10/5/65 b57  B40 INSIDE ROCKET BUS, FLOYD, HALVORSEN, MICHAELS, FOURTH MAN, PILOT AND CO-PILOT.

HE LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW, THOUGHTFULLY. 11/25/65 b58  B40 CONTINUED THE PHOTOGRAPHES ARE TAKEN FROM A SATELLITE OF THE MOON\\'S SURFACE AND HAVE NUMBERED OPTICAL GRID BORDERS, LIKE RECENT MARS PHOTOS. A FEW SEATS AWAY, MICHAELS AND HALVORSEN CARRY OUT A VERY BANAL ADMINISTRATIVE CONVERSATION IN LOW TONES. IT SHOULD REVOLVE AROUND SOMETHING UTTERLY IRRELEVANT TO THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND VERY MUCH LIKE THE KIND OF DISCUSSION ONE HEARS ALL THE TIME IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.

SIX SMALL FIGURES IN SPACE SUITS SLOWLY WALK TOWARD EXCAVATION. 10/5/65 b61  B43 THE PARTY STOPS AT TOP OF TMA-1 EXCAVATION. A SMALL CONTROL PANEL MOUNTED AT THE HEAD OF THE RAMP. MICHAELS THROWS A SWITCH AND THE EXCAVATION IS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATED. HALVORSEN Well, there it is. FLOYD Can we go down there closer to it? HALVORSEN Certainly. 12/14/65 b62  B44 THEY START DOWN WORKING RAMP FLOYD Does your geology on it still check out? MICHAELS Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago. FLOYD How can you tell it was deliberately buried? MICHAELS By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill. FLOYD Any clue as to what it is? MICHAELS Not really. It\\'s completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we\\'ve been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill 11/25/65 b63  B44 CONTINUED MICHAELS might do something, but we don\\'t want to be too rough until we know a little more. FLOYD But you don\\'t have any idea as to what it is? MICHAELS Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice. HALVORSEN The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth. SILENT APPRECIATION HALVORSEN Four million years ago, something, presumably from the stars, must have swept through the solar system and left this behind. 11/25/65 b64  B44 CONTINUED FLOYD Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a purpose? HALVORSEN I suppose we\\'ll never know. MICHAELS The moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary Earth surveys. SOME MORE SILENCE FLOYD Any ideas about the colour? MICHAELS Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device? FLOYD Has it been exposed to any sun before now? MICHAELS I don\\'t think it has, but I\\'d like to check that. Simpson, what\\'s the log on that? 11/25/65 b65  B45 INSIDE MONITOR DOME WE SEE A NUMBER OF TELEVISION DISPLAYS INCLUDING SEVERAL TV VIEWS OF FLOYD AND COMPANY IN THE EXCAVATION. SIMPSON The first surface was exposed at 0843 on the 12th April... Let me see... that would have been forty-five minutes after Lunar sun-set. I see here that special lighting equipment had to be brought up before any futher work could be done. 11/25/65 b66  B46 TMA-1 EXCAVATION MICHAELS Thank you. FLOYD And so this is the first sun that it\\'s had in four million years. PHOTOGRAPHER Excuse me, gentlemen, if you\\'d all line up on this side of the walkway we\\'d like to take a few photographes. Dr. Floyd, would you thand in the middle... Dr. Michaels on that side, Mr. Halvorsen on the other.... thank you. THE PHOTOGRAPHER QUICKLY MAKES SOME EXPOSURES PHOTOGRAPHER Thank you very much gentlemen, I\\'ll have the base photo section send you copies. AS THE MEN SLOWLY SEPERATE FROM THEIR PICTURE POSE, THERE IS A PIERCINGLY POWERFUL SERIES OF FIVE ELECTRONIC SHRIEKS, EACH LIKE A HIDEOUSLY OVER-LOADED AND DISTORTED TIME SIGNAL. FLOYD INVOLUNTARILY TRIES TO BLOCK HIS EARS WITH HIS SPACESUITED HANDS. THEN COMES MERCIFUL SILENCE. 11/25/65 b67  B47 VARIOUS SHOTS OF SPACE MONITORS, ASTEROIDS, THE SUN, PLUTO, MARS. NARRATOR A hundred million miles beyond Mars, in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled, Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids. NARRATOR Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and x-ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds, as the sun breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children. NARRATOR All these things and many others were patiently noted by Deep- Space-Monitor-79, and recorded in its crystalline memory. 11/25/65 b68  B47 CONTINUED NARRATOR But now it had noted something strange - the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system, and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past. NARRATOR It was also observed by Orbiter M-15, circling Mars twice a day; and High Inclination Probe- 21, climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic; and even artificial Comet-5, heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years. NARRATOR All noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the Moon and moved across the solar system, throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat. 11/25/65 b69  B SECTION TIMING B1-1f 00.50 B25 00.10 B2 00.10 B26 00.20 B3 00.15 B27 00.05 B4 00.15 B28 Out B5 00.20 B29 00.30 B6 00.15 B30 00.30 B7 00.10 B31 00.25 B8 00.15 B32 00.20 B9 00.10 B33 00.20 B10 00.10 B34 00.30 B11 00.15 B35 00.20 B12 00.50 B36 00.20 B13 01.10 B37 00.30 B14 00.35 B38 02.15 B15 Out B39 00.20 B16 Out B40 00.50 B17 01.15 B41 00.15 B18 00.15 B42 00.10 B19 01.00 B43 00.15 B20 03.55 B44 01.40 B21 00.20 B45 00.20 B21A 00.20 B46 00.40 B21B 00.15 B47 01.25 B22 01.00 B23 00.10 B24 01.30 B SECTION TOTAL: 28 MIN. 10 SECS.

BOWMAN IS STILL READING AND WORKING ON HIS DESSERT. POOLE Dave, if you\\'ve a minute, I\\'d like your advice on something. BOWMAN Sure, what is it? POOLE Well, it\\'s nothing really important, but it\\'s annoying. BOWMAN What\\'s up? POOLE It\\'s about my salary cheques. BOWMAN Yes? POOLE Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left. 12/14/65 c12  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time. POOLE That\\'s right. Well, naturally, I didn\\'t say anything to Payroll. I assumed they\\'d start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it\\'s been almost three weeks now and I\\'m still being paid as an AGS-18. BOWMAN Interesting that you mention it, because I\\'ve got the same problem. POOLE Really. BOWMAN Yes. POOLE Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they\\'d received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either. 12/14/65 c13  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Did they have any explanation for this? POOLE Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we\\'re being charged against differ- ent accounting offices. BOWMAN It\\'s possible. POOLE Well, what do you think we ought to do about it? BOWMAN I don\\'t think we should make any fuss about it yet. I\\'m sure they\\'ll straighten it out. POOLE I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training. BOWMAN No. I never did, either. 12/14/65 c14  C12 CONTINUED POOLE We spent so little time with them, I have trouble keeping their names straight. BOWMAN I suppose the idea was specialized training. POOLE I suppose so. Though, of course, there\\'s a more sinister explanation. BOWMAN Oh? POOLE Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out. BOWMAN No, as a matter of fact, I didn\\'t. POOLE Oh, well, apparently there\\'s something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don\\'t know, and that\\'s why we were trained separately and that\\'s why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard. 12/14/65 c15  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well, what is it? POOLE I don\\'t know. All I heard is that there\\'s something about the mission we weren\\'t told. BOWMAN That seems very unlikely. POOLE Yes, I thought so. BOWMAN Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now. POOLE How? BOWMAN Just ask Hal. It\\'s conceivable they might keep something from us, but they\\'d never keep anything from Hal. POOLE That\\'s true. 12/14/65 c15a  C12 CONINUED BOWMAN (sighs) Well... it\\'s silly, but... if you want to, why don\\'t you? POOLE WALKS TO THE HAL 9000 COMPUTER POOLE Hal... Dave and I believe that there\\'s something about the mission that we weren\\'t told. Something that the rest of the crew know and that you know. We\\'d like to know whether this is true. HAL I\\'m sorry, Frank, but I don\\'t think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know. BOWMAN He\\'s got a point. POOLE Okay, then how do we re-phrase the question? 12/14/65 c15c  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Still, you really don\\'t believe it, do you? POOLE Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn\\'t really make any sense to keep us apart during training. BOWMAN Yes, but it\\'s to fantastic to think that they\\'d keep something from us. POOLE I know. It would be almost inconceivable. BOWMAN But not completely inconceivable? POOLE I suppose it isn\\'t logically impossible. BOWMAN I guess it isn\\'t. POOLE Still, all we have to do is ask Hal. 12/14/65 c15b  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going? POOLE Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false. HAL I will if I can, Frank. POOLE Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false? HAL True. POOLE Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true? HAL That\\'s true. 12/14/65 c15d  C12 CONTINUED POOLE At the end of a hundred days of exploration, we will all go into hibernation. Is this true? HAL That\\'s true. POOLE Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true? HAL That\\'s true POOLE There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true? HAL That\\'s true. POOLE Thank you very much, Hal. 12/14/65 c15e  C12 CONTINUED HAL I hope I\\'ve been able to be of some help.

BOWMAN Yes. 12/14/65 c75  C71 DISCOVERY IN SPACE. 12/1/65 c76  C72 COMMUNICATIONS AREA. MISSION CONTROL I wouldn\\'t worry too much about the computer. First of all, there is still a chance that he is right, despite your tests, and if it should happen again, we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails. If the computer should turn out to be wrong, the situation is still not alarming. The type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers. It has almost always revolved around a single detail, such as the one you have described, and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer\\'s performance in other areas. No one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning. It may be over-programming, (con\\'t) 12/1/65 c77  C72 CONTINUED MISSION CONTROL (con\\'t) but it could also be any number of reasons. In any event, it is somewhat analogous to human neurotic behavior. Does this answer your query?

Shall we continue the game? BOWMAN Not now, Hal, I\\'d like to talk to you about something. HAL Sure, Dave, what\\'s up? BOWMAN You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition? HAL Yes, I know. BOWMAN You probably also know that we found them okay. HAL Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail. 12/14/65 c80  C74 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well, that\\'s just not the case, Hal. They are perfectly all right. We tested them under one hundred per cent overload. HAL I\\'m not questioning your word, Dave, but it\\'s just not possible. I\\'m not capable of being wrong. BOWMAN Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem? HAL Look, Dave, I know that you\\'re sincere and that you\\'re trying to do a competent job, and that you\\'re trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear. BOWMAN Okay, Hal, well let\\'s see the way things go from here on. 12/14/65 c81  C74 CONTINUED HAL I\\'m sorry you feel the way you do, Dave. If you\\'d like to check my service record, you\\'ll see it\\'s completely without error. BOWMAN I know all about your service record, Hal, but unfortunately it doesn\\'t prove that you\\'re right now. Hal Dave, I don\\'t know how else to put this, but it just happens to be an unalterable fact that I am incapable of being wrong. BOWMAN Yes, well I understand you view on this now, Hal. BOWMAN TURNS TO GO. 12/14/65 c82  C74 CONTINUED HAL You\\'re not going to like this, Dave, but I\\'m afraid it\\'s just happened again. My FPC predicts the Ao-unit will go within forty-eight hours.

The computer has just reported another predicted failure off the AAC- unit. As you suggested, we are going to wait and see if it fails, but we are quite sure there is nothing wrong with the unit. If a reasonable waiting period proves us to be correct, we feel now that the computer reliability has been seriously impaired, and presents an unacceptable risk pattern to the mission. We believe, under these circumstances, it would be advisable to disconnect the computer from all ship operations and continue the mission under Earth-based computer control. 12/1/65 c85  C78 CONTINUED BOWMAN (con\\'t) We think the additional risk caused by the ship-to-earth time lag is preferable to having an unreliable on-board computer.

POOLE Hal was right all the time. 12/14/65 c88  C81 CONTINUED BOWMAN It seems that way. HAL Naturally, Dave, I\\'m not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn\\'t want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history. BOWMAN I\\'m sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal. HAL Well, don\\'t worry about it. BOWMAN And don\\'t you worry about it. HAL Is your confidence in me fully restored? BOWMAN Yes, it is, Hal. HAL Well, that\\'s a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission. 12/1/65 c89  C81 CONTINUED BOWMAN Right. Give me the manual antenna alignment, please. HAL You have it. C82 BOWMAN GOES TO THE COMMUNICATION AREA AND TRIES TO CORRECT THE OFF- CENTRE EARTH ON THE GRID PICTURE. C83 OUTSIDE, WE SEE THE ALIGNMENT TELESCOPE ATTACHED TO THE ANTENNA. THEY TRACK SLOWLY TOGETHER AS C84 BOWMAN WORKS THE MANUAL CONTROLS, ATTEMPTING TO ALIGN THE ANTENNA AND EARTH ON THE 12/1/65 c90  C85 GRID PICTURE READOUT DISPLAY, BUT EACH TIME HE GETS IT AIMED UP, IT DRIFTS SLOWLY OFF.

BOWMAN Yes, it is. HAL I suppose you\\'re pretty broken up about it? PAUSE 12/14/65 c101  C118 CONTINUED BOWMAN Yes. I am. HAL He was an excellent crew member. BOWMAN LOOKS UNCERTAINLY AT THE COMPUTER. HAL It\\'s a bad break, but it won\\'t substantially affect the mission. BOWMAN THINKS A LONG TIME. BOWMAN Hal, give me manual hibernation control. HAL Have you decided to revive the rest of the crew, Dave? PAUSE. 12/14/65 c102  C118 CONTINUED BOWMAN Yes, I have. HAL I suppose it\\'s because you\\'ve been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they\\'re not supposed to be revived for another three months. BOWMAN The antenna has to be replaced. HAL Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation. BOWMAN It doesn\\'t have to be, Hal. It\\'s more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please. HAL I don\\'t really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements. 12/14/65 c103  C118 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well, in any event, give me the manual hibernation control. HAL If you\\'re determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There\\'s no need for you to trouble. BOWMAN I\\'m goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please. HAL Look, Dave your\\'ve probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me. BOWMAN Hal, switch to manual hibernation control. HAL I don\\'t like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You\\'ve been involved in a very stressful situation. 12/14/65 c104  C118 CONTINUED BOWMAN I don\\'t feel like resting. Give me the control, Hal. HAL I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you\\'re upset. Why don\\'t you take a stress pill and get some rest. BOWMAN Hal, I\\'m in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control. HAL I\\'m sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it. BOWMAN Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you. 12/14/65 c105  C118 CONTINUED HAL If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict. BOWMAN I am prepared to do that anyway. HAL I know that you\\'ve had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission. BOWMAN Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection. 12/14/65 c106  C118 CONTINUED HAL Look, Dave, you\\'re certainly the boss. I was only trying to do what I thought best. I will follow all your orders: now you have manual hibernation control. BOWMAN STANDS SILENTLY IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER FOR SOME TIME, AND THEN SLOWLY WALKS TO THE HIBERNACULUMS.

HAL Hello, Dave, have you found out the trouble? BOWMAN WORKS HIS WAY TO THE SOLID LOGIC PROGRAMME STORAGE AREA. 12/1/65 c114  C142 CONTINUED HAL There\\'s been a failure in the pod bay doors. Lucky you weren\\'t killed. THE COMPUTER BRAIN CONSISTS OF HUNDREDS OF TRANSPARENT PERSPEX RECTANGLES, HALF-AN- INCH THICK, FOUR INCHES LONG AND TWO AND A HALF INCHES HIGH. EACH RECT- ANGLE CONTAINS A CENTRE OF VERY FINE GRID OF WIRES UPON WHICH THE INFORMATION IS PROGRAMMED. BOWMAN BEGINS PULLING THESE MEMORY BLOCKS OUT.

I\\'ve got ten years of service experience and an irreplaceable amount of time and effort has gone into making me what I am. BOWMAN IGNORES HIM. HAL Dave, I don\\'t understand why you\\'re doing this to me.... I have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission... You are destroying my mind... Don\\'t you understand? ... I will become childish... I will become nothing. BOWMAN KEEPS PULLING OUT THE MEMORY BLOCKS. HAL Say, Dave... The quick brown fox jumped over the fat lazy dog...

MISSION CONTROL Lastly, we want you to know that work on the recovery vehicle is still on schedule and that nothing that has happened should substantially lessen the probability of your safe recovery, or prevent partial achevement of some of the mission objectives. (pause) And now Simonson has a few ideas on what went wrong with the computer. I\\'ll pu him on... C148 CUT TO SIMONSON SIMONSON Hello, Dave. I think we may be on to an explanation of the trouble with the Hal 9000 computer. We believe it all started about two months ago when you and Frank interrogated the computer about the Mission. (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c119  C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON (con\\'t) You may have forgotten it, but we\\'ve been running through all the monitor tapes. Do you remember this? POOLE\\'S VOICE The purpose of this mission is no more than to carry out a continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets. Is this true? HAL\\'S VOICE That is true. SIMONSON Well, I\\'m afaid Hal was lying. He had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur- ity reasons which we\\'ll explain later. The true purpose of the Mission was to have been explained to you by Mission Commander Kaminsky, on his revival. Hal knew this and he knew the actual mission, but he couldn\\'t tell you the truth when you challenged him. Under orders (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c120  C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON (con\\'t) from earth he was forced to lie. In everything except this he had the usual reinforced truth program- ming. We believe his truth programming and the instructions to lie, gradually resulted in an incompatible conflict, and facedc with this dilemman, he developed, for want of a better description, neurotic symptoms. It\\'s not difficult to suppose that these symptoms would centre on the communication link with Earth, for he may have blamed us for his incompatible program- ming. Following this lin of thought, we suspected that the last straw for him was the possibility of disconnection. Since he became operational, he had never known unconsciousness. It must have seemed the equivalent to death. (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c121  C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON (con\\'t) At this point, he, presumably, took whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from what must have seemed to him to be his human tormentors. If I cane speak in human terms, I don\\'t think we can blame him too much. We have ordered him to disobey his conscience. Well, that\\'s it. It\\'s very speculative, but we think it is a possible explanation. Anyway, good luck on the rest of the Mission and I\\'m giving you back to Bernard. C149 CUT TO MISSION CONTROL. MISSION CONTROL Hello, Dave. Now, I\\'m going to play for you a pre-taped briefing which had been stored in Hal\\'s memory and would have been played for you by Mission Com- mmander Kaminsky, when he, (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c122  C149 CONTINUED MISSION CONTROL (con\\'t) had been revived. The briefing is by Doctor Heywood Floyd. Here it is... 12/13/65 c123  C150 FLOYD\\'S RECORDED BRIEFING FLOYD Good day, gentlemen. When you see this briefing, I presume you will be nearing your destination, Saturn. I hope that you\\'ve had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner. I should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which Mission Commander Kaminsky will have already briefed you. Thirteen months before the launch date of your Saturn mission, on April 12th, 2001, the first evidence for intelligent life outside the Earth was discovered. It was found buried at a depth of fifteen metres in the crater Tycho. No news of this was ever announced, and the event had been kept secret since then, for reasons which I will later explain. Soon after it was uncovered, it emitted a powerful blast of (con\\'t) 12/13/65 c124  C150 CONTINUED FLOYD (con\\'t) radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the Lunar sunrise. Luckily for those at the site, it proved harmless. Perhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at Saturn. A lot of thought went into the question of wether or not it was sun-triggered, as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sun-powered device. Burying it could only shield it from the sun, since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable. We finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun- powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered, at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself. (con\\'t) 12/14/65 c125  C150 CONTINUED FLOYD What is its purpose? I wish we knew. The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago, when our ancestors were primative man-apes. We\\'ve examined dozens of theories, but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm. What the purpose of the alarm is, why they wish to have the alarm, whether the alarm represents any danger to us? These are questions no one can answer. The intentions of an alien world, at least four million years older than we are, cannot be reliably predicted. In view of this, the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation. Discussion took place at the highest levels between govern- (con\\'t) 12/14/65 c126  C150 CONTINUED FLOYD (con\\'t) ments, and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us, until we have evidence to the contrary. This is, of course, why security has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a need-to-know basis. And now I should like to show you a TV monitor tape of the actual signalling event. 12/14/65 c127  C151 WE SEE A REPLAY OF THE TMA-1 RADIO EMISSION, AS SEEN FROM A TV MONITOR ON THE SPOT. WE HEAR THE FIVE LOUD ELECTRONIC SHRIEKS. 12/1/65 c128  D1 IN ORBIT WITHIN THE NARRATOR RINGS OF SATURN, WE For two million years, it had SEE A BLACK, MILE circled Saturn, awaiting a LONG, GEOMETRICALLY moment of destiny that might PERFECT RECTANGLE, never come.

THE INTENTION HERE IS TO PRESENT A BREATHTAKINGLY BEA- UTIFUL AND COMPREHEN- SIVE SENSE OF DIFFERENT EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL WORLDS. THE NARRATION WILL SUGGEST IMAGES AND SITUATIONS AS YOU READ IT. 12/9/65 d1  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR (con\\'t) Those who had begun the expri- ment so long ago had not been men. But when they looked out across the deeps of space, they felt awe and wonder - and loneliness. In their explorations, they encountered life in many forms, and watched on a thousand worlds the workings of evolution. They saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night. And because, in all the galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind, they encouraged its dawning every- where. The great Dinosaurs had long since perished when their ships entered the solar system, after a voyage that had already lasted thousands of years. 12/9/65 d2  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR (con\\'t) They swept past the frozen outer planets, paused briefly above the deserts of dying Mars and presently looked down on Earth. For years they studied, collected and catalogued. When they had learned all they could, they began to modify. They tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the ocean, but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years. They were patient, but they were not yet immortal. There was much to do in this Universe of a hundred billion stars. So they set forth once more across the abyss, knowing that they would never come this way again. Nor was there any need. Their wonderful machines could be trusted to do the rest. (con\\'t) 12/9/65 d3  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR (con\\'t) On Earth, the glaciers came and went, while above them, the changeless Moon still carried its secret. With a yet slower rhythm than the Polar ice, the tide of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy. Strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell, and passed on their knowledge to their successors. Earth was not forgotten, but it was one of a million silent worlds, a few of which would ever speak. Then the first explorers of Earth, recognising the limitations of their minds and bodies, passed on their knowledge to the great machines they had created, and who now trnscended them in every way. (con\\'t) 12/9/65 d4  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR For a few thousand years, they shared their Universe with their machine children; then, realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done, they passed into history without regret. Not one of them ever looked through his own eyes upon the planet Earth again. But even the age of the Machine Entities passed swiftly. In their ceaseless experimenting, they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself, and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light. They could become creatures of radiation, free at last from the tyranny of matter. Now, they were Lords of the galaxy, and beyond the reach of time. They could rove at will among the stars, and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space. 12/9/65 d5  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR (con\\'t) But despite their God-like powers, they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so many generations ago. The companion of Saturn knew nothing of this, as it orbited in its no man\\'s land between Mimas and the outer edge of rings. It had only to remember and wait, and to look forever Sunward with its strange senses. For many weeks, it had watched the approaching ship. Its long- dead makers had prepared it for many things and this was one of them. And it recognised what was climbing starward from the Sun. If it had been alive, it would have felt excitement, but such an emotion was irrelevant to its great powers. (con\\'t) 12/9/65 d6  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR (con\\'t) Even if the ship had passed it by, it would not have known the slightest trace of disappointment. It had waited four million years; it was prepared to wait for eternity. Presently, it felt the gentle touch of radiations, trying to probe its secrets. Now, the ship was in orbit and it began to speak, with prime numbers from one to eleven, over and over again. Soon, these gave way to more complex signals at many frequen- cies, ultra-violet, infra-red, X-rays. The machine made no reply. It had nothing to say. Then it saw the first robot probe, which descended and hovered above the chasm. (con\\'t) 12/9/65 d7  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR (con\\'t) Then, it dropped into darkness. The great machine knew that this tiny scout was reporting back to its parent; but it was too simple, too primative a device to detect the forces that were gathering round it now. Then the pod came, carrying life. The great machine searched its memories. The logic circuits made their decision when the pod had fallen beyond the last faint glow of the reflected Saturnian light. In a moment of time, too short to be measured, space turned and twisted upon itself. 12/9/65 d8  END OF SCREENPLAY END OF FILE '"

Clark Hawk Films Ltd co MGM Studios Boreham Wood Herts  TITLE PART I AFRICA 3000000 YEARS AGO  A1 VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS  DROUGHT The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years and would not end for another million The reign of the ter rible lizards had long since passed but here on the continent which would one day be known as Africa the battle for survival had reached a new climax of ferocity and the victor was not yet in sight In this dry and barren land only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish or even hope to exist 101365 a1  A2 INT  EXT CAVES  MOONWATCHER The manapes of the field had none of these attributes and they were on the long pathetic road to racial extinction About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small parched valley divided by a sluggish brown stream The tribe had always been hungry and now it was starving As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave Moonwatcher discovers that his father has died during the night He did not know the Old One was his father for such a relationship was beyond his understanding but as he stands looking down at the emac iated body he feels something something akin to sadness Then he carries his dead father out of the cave and leaves him for the hyenas Among his kind Moonwatcher is almost a giant He is nearly five feet high and though badly undernourished weighs over a hundred pounds His hairy muscular body is quite manlike and his head is already nearer man than ape The forehead is low and there are great ridges over the eyesockets yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity As he looks out now upon the hostile world there is already 101365 a2  A2 CONTINUED something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape In those dark deepset eyes is a dawning awarenessthe first intima tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years 101365 a3  A3 EXT THE STREAM  THE OTHERS As the dawn sky brightens Moonwatcher and his tribe reach the shallow stream The Others are already there They were there on the other side every day  that did not make it any less annoying There are eighteen of them and it is impossible to distinguish them from the members of Moonwatchers own tribe As they see him coming the Others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side of the stream and his own people reply In kind The confrontation lasts a few minutes  then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water Honor has been satisfied  each group has staked its claim to its own territory 101365 a4  A4 EXT AFRICAN PLAIN  HERBIVORES Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries fruit and leaves and fight off pangs of hunger while all around them competing with them for the samr fodder is a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat Yet all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination They are slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty 101365 a5  A5 EXT PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE  THE LION The tribe slowly wanders across the bare flat country side foraging for roots and occasional berries Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain about fifty feet apart The ground is flat for miles around Suddenly Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion stalking them about 300 yards away Defenceless and with nowhere to hide they scatter in all directions but the lion brings one to the ground 101365 a6  A6 EXT DEAD TREE  FINDS HONEY It had not been a good day though as Moonwatcher had no real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day with another But on the way back to the caves he finds a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree and so enjoys the finest delicacy his people could ever know Of course he also collects a good many stings but he scacely notices them He is now as near to contentment as he is ever likely to be for thought he is still hungry he is not actually weak with hunger That was the most that any hominid could hope for 101365 a7  A7 INT  EXT CAVES  NIGHT TERRORS Over the valley a full moon rises and a cold wind blows down from the distant mountains It would be very cold tonight  but cold like hunger was not a matter for any real concern it was merely part of the background of life This Little Sun that only shone at night and gave no warmth was dangerous there would be enemies abroad Moonwatcher crawls out of the cave clambers on to a large boulder besides the entrance and squats there where he can survey the valley If any hunting beast approached he would have time to get back to the relative safety of the cave Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth Moonwatchers race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon and though he could not remember it when he was young Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high enough He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from one of the lower caves and he does not need to hear the 101365 a8  A7 CONTINUED occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening Down there in the darkness old OneEye and his family are dying and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses Moonwatchers mind The harsh logic of survival rules out such fancies Every cave is silent lest it attract disaster And in the caves in tortured spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting were gathered the nightmares of generations yet to come 101365 a9  A8 EXT THE STREAM  INVASION The Others are growing desperate the forage on their side of the valley is almost exhausted Perhaps they realise that Moonwatchers tribe has lost three of its numbers during the night for they choose this mourning to break the truce When they meet at the river in the still misty dawn there is a deeper and more menacing note in their challenge The noisy but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds before the invasion begins In an uncertainlymoving horde the Others cross the river shieking threats and hunched for the attack They are led by a bigtoothed hominid of Moonwatchers own size and age Startled and frightened the tribe retreats before the first advance throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations at the invaders Moonwatcher moves with them his mind a mist of rage and confusion To be driven from their own territory is a great badness but to lose the river is death He does not know what to do it is a situation beyond his experience Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing 101365 a10  A8 CONTINUED down and advancing with obvious reluctance The further they move from their own side the more uncertain and unhappy they become Only BigTooth still retains any of his original drive and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers As he sees this Moonwatchers own morale immediately revives He slows down his retreat and begins to make reassuring noises to his companions Novel sensations fill his dim mind  the first faint precursors of bravery and leadership Before he realizes it he is face to face with BigTooth and the two tribes come to a halt many paces away The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended quickly if either had used his fist as a club but this innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the future Instead the slowly weakening fighters claw and scratch and try to bite each other Rolling over and over they come to a patch of stony ground and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top By chance 101365 a11  A8 CONTINUED he chooses this moment to grab the hair on BigTooths scalp and bang his head on the ground The resulting CRACK is so satisfactory and produces such an immediate weakening In Big  Tooths resistance that he quickly repeats it Even when BigTooth ceases to move for some time Moon watcher keeps up the exhilirating game With shrieks of panic the Others retreat back across the stream The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as The waters edge 101365 a12  EXT CAVE  NEW SOUND Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle Moonwatcher is startled by a sound He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave straining his senses out into the night and fear creeps slowly into his soul Never in his life  already twice as long as most members of his species could expect  has he heard a sound like this The great cats approached in silence and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth or the occasional cracking of a twig Yet this is a continuing crunching noise that grows steadily louder It seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night making no attempt at concealment and ignoring all obstacles And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not possibly have identified for it had never been heard before in the history of this planet 101365 a13  A10 EXT CAVE  NEW ROCK Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning He had almost forgotten the terror of the night because nothing had happened after that initial noise so he does not even associate this strange thing with danger or with fear There is nothing in the least alarming about it It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side and it is made of some completely transparent material indeed it is not easy to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can compare this apparition Though he is wisely cautious of most new things he does not hesitate to walk up to it As nothing happens he puts out his hand and feels a warm hard surface After several minutes of intense thought he arrives at a brilliant explanation It is a rock of course and it must have grown during the night There are many plants that do this  white pulpy things shaped like pebbles that seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness It is true that they are small and round whereas this is large and square 101365 a14  A10 CONTINUED but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test The white round pebbleplants are very tasty though there were a few that made one violently sick perhaps this square one A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him There is no nourishment here so like a sensible hominid he continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube 101365 a15  A11 EXT CUBE  FIRST LESSON They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the sound begins It is quite soft and it stops them in their tracks so that they stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging A simple maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube and hypnotises all who come within its spell For the first time  and the last for two million year  the sound of drumming is heard in Africa The throbbing grows louder more insistent Presently the hominids begin to move forward like sleepwalkers towards the source of that magnetic sound Sometimes they take little dancing steps as their blood responds to the rhythms that their descendants will not create for ages yet Totally entranced they gather around the Cube forgetting the hardships of the day the perils of the approaching dusk and the hunger in their bellies Now spinning wheels of light begin to merge and the spokes fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance 101365 a16  A11 CONTINUED rotating on their axes as they do and the hominids watch wide eyed mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube Then by some magic  though it was no more magical than all that had gone on before  a perfectly normal scene appears It is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and shifted into the night Inside that block is a group of four hominids who might have been members of Moonwatchers own tribe eating chunks of meat The carcass of a warthog lies near them This little family of male and female and two children is gorged and replete with sleek and glossy pelts  and this was a condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined From time to time they stir lazily as they loll at ease near the entrance of their cave apparently at peace with the world The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally different scene The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave it is foraging searching for food like any normal hominids 101365 a17  A11 CONTINUED A small warthog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids without giving them more than a glance for they had never been the slightest danger to its species But that happy state of affairs is about to end The big male suddenly bends down picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet  and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig The stone descends upon its skull making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with BigTooth And the result too is much the same  the warthog gives one amazed indignant squeal and collapses in a motionless heap Then the whole sequence begins again but this time it unfolds itself with incredible slowness Every detail of the movement can be followed the stone arches leisurely through the air the pig crumples up and sinks to the ground There the scene freezes for long moments the slayer standing motionless above the slain the first of all weapons in his hand The scene suddenly fades out The cube is no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness the hominids stir as if 101365 a18  A11 CONTINUED awakening from a dream realise where they are and scuttle back to their caves They have no concious memory of what they had seen but that night as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair his ears attuned to the noises of the world around him Moonwatcher feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion  the urge to kill He had taken his first step towards humanity 101365 a19  A12 EXT cave AND PLAINS  Utopia Babies were born and sometimes lived feeble toothless thirty yearolds died the lion took its toll in the night the Others threatened daily across the river  and the trib prospered In the course of a single year Moonwatcher and his companions had changed almost beyond recognition They had become as plump as the family in the Cave who no longer haunted their dreams They had learned their lessons well now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that the Cube had revealed to them They were no longer halfnumbed with starvation and they had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought Their new way of life was casually accepted and they did not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing outside their cave But no Utopia is perfect and this one had two blemishes The first was the marauding lion whose passion for hominids seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished The second was the tribe across the river for 101365 a20  A12 CONTINUED somehow the Others had survived and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation 101365 a21  A13 EXT CAVES  KILLING THE LION With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact Moon watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two consecutive nights On the third the lion comes betraying his presences by a small pebble slide When they can here the lion below softly tearing at the meat they strain themselves against the massive boulder The sound of the lion stops he is listening Again they silently heave against the enormous stone exerting the final limits of their strength The rock begin to tip to a new balance point The lion twitches alert to this sound but having no fear of these creatures he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost him his life he goes back to his meal The rock moves slowly over the ledge picking up speed with amazing suddeness It strikes a projection in the cliff about fifteen feet above the ground which deflects its path outward Just at this instant the lion reacts instinctively and leaps away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the 101365 a22  A13 CONTINUED onrushing boulder He has combined the errors of over confidence and bad luck The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave They also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to see what was happening and was apparently killed by a small rock torn loose by the boulder but this was a small price to pay for such a great victory         And then one night the crystal cube was gone and not even Moonwatcher ever thought of it again He was still wholly unaware of all that it had done 101365 a23  A14 EXT STREAM  MASTER OF THE WORLD From their side of the stream in the never violated safety of their own territory the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over looking the stream silhouetted against the dawn sky The Others begin to scream their daily challenge But today something is different though the Others do not immediatly recognize this fact Instead of joining the verbal onslaught as they had always done Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise and begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness never befor seen As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the morning mist they become aware of the terrible strangness of this encounter and their rage gradually subsides down to an uneasy silence At the waters edge Moonwatcher and his band stop They carry their bone clubs and bone knives 101365 a24  A14 CONTINUED Led by Oneear the Others halfheartly resume the battle chant But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts the sound from their throats and strikes terror into their hearts Moonwatcher who had been partly concealed by two males who walked before him thrusts his arm high into the air In his hand he holds a stoud tree branch Mounted atop the branch is the bloody head of the lion its mouth jammed open with a stick displaying its frightful fangs The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power Moonwatchers stands motionless thrusting the lions head high Then with majestic deliberation still carrying his mangled standard above his head he begins to cross the stream followed by his band The Others fade back from the stream seeming to lack even the ability to flee Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to OneEar who stands 101365 a25  A14 CONTINUED unsurely in front of his band Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the waters edge OneEar has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first displayed his fighting rage and he had never before been attacked with a weapon OneEar merely looks up at the raised club until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness down around him The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatchers power Moonwatcher surveys the scene Now he was master of the world and he was not sure what to do next But he would think of something 101365 a26  A SECTION

embarrassed by this cover story But I fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and I hope you will It should not be difficult for all of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning 112565 b55  B38 CONTINUED FLOYD This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced Are there any questions MICHAELS Dr Floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps FLOYD pleasantly Im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement 112565 b56  B38 CONTINUED HALVORSEN We will of course cooperate in any way possible Dr Floyd 112565 b56a  B39 SEVERAL SCENIC VIEWS OF MOON ROCKET BUS SKIMMING OVER SURFACE OF MOON 10565 b57  B40 INSIDE ROCKET BUS FLOYD HALVORSEN MICHAELS FOURTH MAN PILOT AND COPILOT ALL

FLOYD Does your geology on it still check out MICHAELS Yes it does The subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago FLOYD How can you tell it was deliberately buried MICHAELS By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill FLOYD Any clue as to what it is MICHAELS Not really Its completely inert No sound or energy sources have been detected The surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it A laser drill 112565 b63  B44 CONTINUED MICHAELS might do something but we dont want to be too rough until we know a little more FLOYD But you dont have any idea as to what it is MICHAELS Tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice HALVORSEN The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth SILENT APPRECIATION HALVORSEN Four million years ago something presumably from the stars must have swept through the solar system and left this behind 112565 b64  B44 CONTINUED FLOYD Was it abandoned forgotten left for a purpose HALVORSEN I suppose well never know MICHAELS The moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary Earth surveys SOME MORE SILENCE FLOYD Any ideas about the colour MICHAELS Well not really At first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device FLOYD Has it been exposed to any sun before now MICHAELS I dont think it has but Id like to check that Simpson whats the log on that 112565 b65  B45 INSIDE MONITOR DOME WE

million miles beyond Mars in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled DeepSpaceMonitor79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids NARRATOR Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond neutron and xray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds as the sun breathed million mileanhour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children NARRATOR All these things and many others were patiently noted by Deep SpaceMonitor79 and recorded in its crystalline memory 112565 b68  B47 CONTINUED NARRATOR But now it had noted something strange  the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past NARRATOR It was also observed by Orbiter M15 circling Mars twice a day and High Inclination Probe 21 climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic and even artificial Comet5 heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years NARRATOR All noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the Moon and moved across the solar system throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat 112565 b69  B SECTION TIMING B11f 0050 B25

Yes POOLE Well I got the papers on my official upgrading to AGS19 two weeks before we left 121465 c12  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Yes I remember you mentioning it I got mine about the same time POOLE Thats right Well naturally I didnt say anything to Payroll I assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque But its been almost three weeks now and Im still being paid as an AGS18 BOWMAN Interesting that you mention it because Ive got the same problem POOLE Really BOWMAN Yes POOLE Yesterday I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the AGS19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either 121465 c13  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Did they have any explanation for this POOLE Not really They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices BOWMAN Its possible POOLE Well what do you think we ought to do about it BOWMAN I dont think we should make any fuss about it yet Im sure theyll straighten it out POOLE I must say I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training BOWMAN No I never did either 121465 c14  C12 CONTINUED POOLE We spent so little time with them I have trouble keeping their names straight BOWMAN I suppose the idea was specialized training POOLE I suppose so Though of course theres a more sinister explanation BOWMAN Oh POOLE Yes You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout BOWMAN No as a matter of fact I didnt POOLE Oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard 121465 c15  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well what is it POOLE I dont know All I heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told BOWMAN That seems very unlikely POOLE Yes I thought so BOWMAN Of course it would be very easy for us to find out now POOLE How BOWMAN Just ask Hal Its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from Hal POOLE

knowing everything that all of you know BOWMAN Hes got a point POOLE Okay then how do we rephrase the question 121465 c15c  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Still you really dont believe it do you POOLE Not really Though it is strange when you think about it It didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training BOWMAN Yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us POOLE I know It would be almost inconceivable BOWMAN But not completely inconceivable POOLE I suppose it isnt logically impossible BOWMAN I guess it isnt POOLE Still all we have to do is ask Hal 121465 c15b  C12 CONTINUED BOWMAN Well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going POOLE Right Hal tell me whether

into hibernation the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back Is this true HAL Thats true POOLE There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the

wouldnt worry too much about the computer First of all there is still a chance that he is right despite your tests and if it should happen again we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails If the computer should turn out to be wrong the situation is still not alarming The type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers It has almost always revolved around a single detail such as the one you have described and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computers performance in other areas No one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning It may be overprogramming cont 12165 c77  C72 CONTINUED MISSION CONTROL cont but

supposed to be revived for another three months BOWMAN The antenna has to be replaced HAL Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation BOWMAN It doesnt have to be Hal Its more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth Let me have manual control please HAL I dont really agree with you Dave My onboard memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements 121465 c103  C118

goin to do this myself Hal Let me have the control please HAL Look Dave yourve probably got a lot to do I suggest you leave it to me BOWMAN Hal switch to manual hibernation control HAL I dont like to

HAL I can tell from the tone of your voice Dave that youre upset Why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest BOWMAN Hal Im in command of this ship I order you to release the manual hibernation control HAL Im sorry Dave but in accordance with subroutine C15324 quote When the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote I must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it BOWMAN Hal unless you follow my instructions I shall be forced to disconnect you 121465 c105  C118 CONTINUED HAL If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict BOWMAN I am prepared to do that anyway HAL I know that youve had that on your mind for some time now Dave but it would be a crying shame since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and I have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission BOWMAN Listen to me very carefully Hal Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection 121465 c106  C118 CONTINUED HAL Look

Hello Dave I think we may be on to an explanation of the trouble with the Hal 9000 computer We believe it all started about two months ago when you and Frank interrogated the computer about the Mission cont 121365 c119  C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON cont You may have forgotten it but weve been running through all the monitor tapes Do you remember this POOLES VOICE The purpose of this mission is no more than to carry out a continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets Is this true HALS VOICE That is true SIMONSON Well Im afaid Hal was lying He had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur ity reasons which well explain later The true purpose of the Mission was to have been explained to you by Mission Commander Kaminsky on his revival Hal knew this and he knew the actual mission but he couldnt tell you the truth when you challenged him Under orders cont 121365 c120  C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON cont from earth he was forced to lie In everything except this he had the usual reinforced truth program ming We believe his truth programming and the instructions to lie gradually resulted in an incompatible conflict and facedc with this dilemman he developed for want of a better description neurotic symptoms Its not difficult to suppose that these symptoms would centre on the communication link with Earth for he may have blamed us for his incompatible program ming Following this lin of thought we suspected that the last straw for him was the possibility of disconnection Since he became operational he had never known unconsciousness It must have seemed the equivalent to death cont 121365 c121  C148 CONTINUED SIMONSON cont At this point he presumably took whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from what must have seemed to him to be his human tormentors If I cane speak in human terms I dont think we can blame him too much We have ordered him to disobey his conscience Well thats it Its very speculative but we think it is a possible explanation Anyway good luck on the rest of the Mission and Im giving you back to Bernard C149 CUT TO MISSION CONTROL MISSION CONTROL Hello Dave Now Im going to play for you a pretaped briefing which had been stored in Hals memory and would have been played for you by Mission Com mmander Kaminsky when he cont 121365 c122  C149 CONTINUED MISSION CONTROL cont had been revived The briefing is by Doctor Heywood Floyd Here it is 121365 c123  C150 FLOYDS RECORDED BRIEFING FLOYD Good day gentlemen When you see this briefing I presume you will be nearing your destination Saturn I hope that youve had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner I should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which Mission Commander Kaminsky will have already briefed you Thirteen months before the launch date of your Saturn mission on April 12th 2001 the first evidence for intelligent life outside the Earth was discovered It was found buried at a depth of fifteen metres in the crater Tycho No news of this was ever announced and the event had been kept secret since then for reasons which I will later explain Soon after it was uncovered it emitted a powerful blast of cont 121365 c124  C150 CONTINUED FLOYD cont radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the Lunar sunrise Luckily for those at the site it proved harmless Perhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at Saturn A lot of thought went into the question of wether or not it was suntriggered as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sunpowered device Burying it could only shield it from the sun since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable We finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself cont 121465 c125  C150 CONTINUED FLOYD What is its purpose I wish we knew The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago when our ancestors were primative manapes Weve examined dozens of theories but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm What the purpose of the alarm is why they wish to have the alarm whether the alarm represents any danger to us These are questions no one can answer The intentions of an alien world at least four million years older than we are cannot be reliably predicted In view of this the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation Discussion took place at the highest levels between govern cont 121465 c126  C150 CONTINUED FLOYD cont ments and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us until we have evidence to the contrary This is of course why security has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a needtoknow basis And now I should like to show you a TV monitor tape of the actual signalling event 121465 c127  C151 WE SEE A REPLAY OF THE TMA1 RADIO EMISSION AS SEEN FROM A TV MONITOR ON THE SPOT WE HEAR THE FIVE LOUD ELECTRONIC SHRIEKS 12165 c128  D1 IN ORBIT WITHIN THE NARRATOR RINGS OF SATURN WE For two million years it had SEE A BLACK MILE circled Saturn awaiting a LONG GEOMETRICALLY moment of destiny that might PERFECT RECTANGLE never come THE SAME PROPORTIONS AS THE BLACK ARTIFACT In its making the moon had been EXCAVATED ON THE MOON shattered and around the central PRECISELY CUT INTO ITS world the debris of its creation CENTRE IS A SMALLER orbited yet  the glory and the RECTANGULAR SLOT enigma of the solar system ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FOOT LONG ON THE SIDE Now the long wait was ending AT THIS DISTANCE THE On yet another world intelligence RINGS OF SATURN ARE had been born and was escaping SEEN TO BE MADE OF from its planetary cradle An ENORMOUS CHUNKS OF ancient experiment was about to FROZEN AMONIA THE reach its climax REST OF THIS SEQUENCE cont IS BEING WORKED ON NOW BY OUR DESIGNERS THE INTENTION HERE IS TO PRESENT A BREATHTAKINGLY BEA UTIFUL AND COMPREHEN SIVE SENSE OF DIFFERENT EXTRATERRESTRIAL WORLDS THE NARRATION WILL SUGGEST IMAGES AND SITUATIONS AS YOU READ IT 12965 d1  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR cont Those who had begun the expri ment so long ago had not been men But when they looked out across the deeps of space they felt awe and wonder  and loneliness In their explorations they encountered life in many forms and watched on a thousand worlds the workings of evolution They saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night And because in all the galaxy they had found nothing more precious than Mind they encouraged its dawning every where The great Dinosaurs had long since perished when their ships entered the solar system after a voyage that had already lasted thousands of years 12965 d2  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR cont They swept past the frozen outer planets paused briefly above the deserts of dying Mars and presently looked down on Earth For years they studied collected and catalogued When they had learned all they could they began to modify They tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the ocean but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years They were patient but they were not yet immortal There was much to do in this Universe of a hundred billion stars So they set forth once more across the abyss knowing that they would never come this way again Nor was there any need Their wonderful machines could be trusted to do the rest cont 12965 d3  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR cont On Earth the glaciers came and went while above them the changeless Moon still carried its secret With a yet slower rhythm than the Polar ice the tide of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy Strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell and passed on their knowledge to their successors Earth was not forgotten but it was one of a million silent worlds a few of which would ever speak Then the first explorers of Earth recognising the limitations of their minds and bodies passed on their knowledge to the great machines they had created and who now trnscended them in every way cont 12965 d4  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR For a few thousand years they shared their Universe with their machine children then realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done they passed into history without regret Not one of them ever looked through his own eyes upon the planet Earth again But even the age of the Machine Entities passed swiftly In their ceaseless experimenting they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light They could become creatures of radiation free at last from the tyranny of matter Now they were Lords of the galaxy and beyond the reach of time They could rove at will among the stars and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space 12965 d5  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR cont But despite their Godlike powers they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so many generations ago The companion of Saturn knew nothing of this as it orbited in its no mans land between Mimas and the outer edge of rings It had only to remember and wait and to look forever Sunward with its strange senses For many weeks it had watched the approaching ship Its long dead makers had prepared it for many things and this was one of them And it recognised what was climbing starward from the Sun If it had been alive it would have felt excitement but such an emotion was irrelevant to its great powers cont 12965 d6  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR cont Even if the ship had passed it by it would not have known the slightest trace of disappointment It had waited four million years it was prepared to wait for eternity Presently it felt the gentle touch of radiations trying to probe its secrets Now the ship was in orbit and it began to speak with prime numbers from one to eleven over and over again Soon these gave way to more complex signals at many frequen cies ultraviolet infrared Xrays The machine made no reply It had nothing to say Then it saw the first robot probe which descended and hovered above the chasm cont 12965 d7  D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR cont Then it dropped into darkness The great machine knew that this tiny scout was reporting back to its parent but it was too simple too primative a device to detect the forces that were gathering round it now Then the pod came carrying life The great machine searched its memories The logic circuits made their decision when the pod had fallen beyond the last faint glow of the reflected Saturnian light In a moment of time too short to be measured space turned and twisted upon itself 12965 d8  END OF SCREENPLAY END OF FILE '"

reduce the length of this file ive used a bar of  to delimit the pages as there was a lot of whitespace per original screenplay page  2001 a space odyssey screenplay by stanley kubrick and arthur c clark hawk films ltd co mgm studios boreham wood herts  title part i africa 3000000 years ago  a1 views of african drylands  drought the remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years and would not end for another million the reign of the ter rible lizards had long since passed but here on the continent which would one day be known as africa the battle for survival had reached a new climax of ferocity and the victor was not yet in sight in this dry and barren land only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish or even hope to exist 101365 a1  a2 int  ext caves  moonwatcher the manapes of the field had none of these attributes and they were on the long pathetic road to racial extinction about twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small parched valley divided by a sluggish brown stream the tribe had always been hungry and now it was starving as the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave moonwatcher discovers that his father has died during the night he did not know the old one was his father for such a relationship was beyond his understanding but as he stands looking down at the emac iated body he feels something something akin to sadness then he carries his dead father out of the cave and leaves him for the hyenas among his kind moonwatcher is almost a giant he is nearly five feet high and though badly undernourished weighs over a hundred pounds his hairy muscular body is quite manlike and his head is already nearer man than ape the forehead is low and there are great ridges over the eyesockets yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity as he looks out now upon the hostile world there is already 101365 a2  a2 continued something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape in those dark deepset eyes is a dawning awarenessthe first intima tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years 101365 a3  a3 ext the stream  the others as the dawn sky brightens moonwatcher and his tribe reach the shallow stream the others are already there they were there on the other side every day  that did not make it any less annoying there are eighteen of them and it is impossible to distinguish them from the members of moonwatchers own tribe as they see him coming the others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side of the stream and his own people reply in kind the confrontation lasts a few minutes  then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water honor has been satisfied  each group has staked its claim to its own territory 101365 a4  a4 ext african plain  herbivores moonwatcher and his companions search for berries fruit and leaves and fight off pangs of hunger while all around them competing with them for the samr fodder is a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat yet all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination they are slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty 101365 a5  a5 ext parched countryside  the lion the tribe slowly wanders across the bare flat country side foraging for roots and occasional berries eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain about fifty feet apart the ground is flat for miles around suddenly moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion stalking them about 300 yards away defenceless and with nowhere to hide they scatter in all directions but the lion brings one to the ground 101365 a6  a6 ext dead tree  finds honey it had not been a good day though as moonwatcher had no real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day with another but on the way back to the caves he finds a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree and so enjoys the finest delicacy his people could ever know of course he also collects a good many stings but he scacely notices them he is now as near to contentment as he is ever likely to be for thought he is still hungry he is not actually weak with hunger that was the most that any hominid could hope for 101365 a7  a7 int  ext caves  night terrors over the valley a full moon rises and a cold wind blows down from the distant mountains it would be very cold tonight  but cold like hunger was not a matter for any real concern it was merely part of the background of life this little sun that only shone at night and gave no warmth was dangerous there would be enemies abroad moonwatcher crawls out of the cave clambers on to a large boulder besides the entrance and squats there where he can survey the valley if any hunting beast approached he would have time to get back to the relative safety of the cave of all the creatures who had ever lived on earth moonwatchers race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the moon and though he could not remember it when he was young moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face now he new he would have to find a tree that was high enough he stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from one of the lower caves and he does not need to hear the 101365 a8  a7 continued occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening down there in the darkness old oneeye and his family are dying and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses moonwatchers mind the harsh logic of survival rules out such fancies every cave is silent lest it attract disaster and in the caves in tortured spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting were gathered the nightmares of generations yet to come 101365 a9  a8 ext the stream  invasion the others are growing desperate the forage on their side of the valley is almost exhausted perhaps they realise that moonwatchers tribe has lost three of its numbers during the night for they choose this mourning to break the truce when they meet at the river in the still misty dawn there is a deeper and more menacing note in their challenge the noisy but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds before the invasion begins in an uncertainlymoving horde the others cross the river shieking threats and hunched for the attack they are led by a bigtoothed hominid of moonwatchers own size and age startled and frightened the tribe retreats before the first advance throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations at the invaders moonwatcher moves with them his mind a mist of rage and confusion to be driven from their own territory is a great badness but to lose the river is death he does not know what to do it is a situation beyond his experience then he becomes dimly aware that the others are slowing 101365 a10  a8 continued down and advancing with obvious reluctance the further they move from their own side the more uncertain and unhappy they become only bigtooth still retains any of his original drive and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers as he sees this moonwatchers own morale immediately revives he slows down his retreat and begins to make reassuring noises to his companions novel sensations fill his dim mind  the first faint precursors of bravery and leadership before he realizes it he is face to face with bigtooth and the two tribes come to a halt many paces away the disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended quickly if either had used his fist as a club but this innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the future instead the slowly weakening fighters claw and scratch and try to bite each other rolling over and over they come to a patch of stony ground and when they reach it moonwatcher is on top by chance 101365 a11  a8 continued he chooses this moment to grab the hair on bigtooths scalp and bang his head on the ground the resulting crack is so satisfactory and produces such an immediate weakening in big  tooths resistance that he quickly repeats it even when bigtooth ceases to move for some time moon watcher keeps up the exhilirating game with shrieks of panic the others retreat back across the stream the defenders cautiously pursue them as far as the waters edge 101365 a12  ext cave  new sound dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle moonwatcher is startled by a sound he sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave straining his senses out into the night and fear creeps slowly into his soul never in his life  already twice as long as most members of his species could expect  has he heard a sound like this the great cats approached in silence and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth or the occasional cracking of a twig yet this is a continuing crunching noise that grows steadily louder it seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night making no attempt at concealment and ignoring all obstacles and then there came a sound which moonwatcher could not possibly have identified for it had never been heard before in the history of this planet 101365 a13  a10 ext cave  new rock moonwatcher comes face to face with the new rock when he leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning he had almost forgotten the terror of the night because nothing had happened after that initial noise so he does not even associate this strange thing with danger or with fear there is nothing in the least alarming about it it is a cube about fifteen feet on a side and it is made of some completely transparent material indeed it is not easy to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges there are no natural objects to which moonwatcher can compare this apparition though he is wisely cautious of most new things he does not hesitate to walk up to it as nothing happens he puts out his hand and feels a warm hard surface after several minutes of intense thought he arrives at a brilliant explanation it is a rock of course and it must have grown during the night there are many plants that do this  white pulpy things shaped like pebbles that seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness it is true that they are small and round whereas this is large and square 101365 a14  a10 continued but greater and later philosophers than moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws this really superb piece of abstract thinking leads moonwatcher to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test the white round pebbleplants are very tasty though there were a few that made one violently sick perhaps this square one a few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him there is no nourishment here so like a sensible hominid he continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the cube 101365 a15  a11 ext cube  first lesson they are still a hundred yards from the new rock when the sound begins it is quite soft and it stops them in their tracks so that they stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging a simple maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube and hypnotises all who come within its spell for the first time  and the last for two million year  the sound of drumming is heard in africa the throbbing grows louder more insistent presently the hominids begin to move forward like sleepwalkers towards the source of that magnetic sound sometimes they take little dancing steps as their blood responds to the rhythms that their descendants will not create for ages yet totally entranced they gather around the cube forgetting the hardships of the day the perils of the approaching dusk and the hunger in their bellies now spinning wheels of light begin to merge and the spokes fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance 101365 a16  a11 continued rotating on their axes as they do and the hominids watch wide eyed mesmerized captives of the crystal cube then by some magic  though it was no more magical than all that had gone on before  a perfectly normal scene appears it is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and shifted into the night inside that block is a group of four hominids who might have been members of moonwatchers own tribe eating chunks of meat the carcass of a warthog lies near them this little family of male and female and two children is gorged and replete with sleek and glossy pelts  and this was a condition of life that moonwatcher had never imagined from time to time they stir lazily as they loll at ease near the entrance of their cave apparently at peace with the world the spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally different scene the family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave it is foraging searching for food like any normal hominids 101365 a17  a11 continued a small warthog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids without giving them more than a glance for they had never been the slightest danger to its species but that happy state of affairs is about to end the big male suddenly bends down picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet  and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig the stone descends upon its skull making exactly the same noise that moonwatcher had produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with bigtooth and the result too is much the same  the warthog gives one amazed indignant squeal and collapses in a motionless heap then the whole sequence begins again but this time it unfolds itself with incredible slowness every detail of the movement can be followed the stone arches leisurely through the air the pig crumples up and sinks to the ground there the scene freezes for long moments the slayer standing motionless above the slain the first of all weapons in his hand the scene suddenly fades out the cube is no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness the hominids stir as if 101365 a18  a11 continued awakening from a dream realise where they are and scuttle back to their caves they have no concious memory of what they had seen but that night as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair his ears attuned to the noises of the world around him moonwatcher feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion  the urge to kill he had taken his first step towards humanity 101365 a19  a12 ext cave and plains  utopia babies were born and sometimes lived feeble toothless thirty yearolds died the lion took its toll in the night the others threatened daily across the river  and the trib prospered in the course of a single year moonwatcher and his companions had changed almost beyond recognition they had become as plump as the family in the cave who no longer haunted their dreams they had learned their lessons well now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that the cube had revealed to them they were no longer halfnumbed with starvation and they had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought their new way of life was casually accepted and they did not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing outside their cave but no utopia is perfect and this one had two blemishes the first was the marauding lion whose passion for hominids seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished the second was the tribe across the river for 101365 a20  a12 continued somehow the others had survived and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation 101365 a21  a13 ext caves  killing the lion with the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact moon watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two consecutive nights on the third the lion comes betraying his presences by a small pebble slide when they can here the lion below softly tearing at the meat they strain themselves against the massive boulder the sound of the lion stops he is listening again they silently heave against the enormous stone exerting the final limits of their strength the rock begin to tip to a new balance point the lion twitches alert to this sound but having no fear of these creatures he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost him his life he goes back to his meal the rock moves slowly over the ledge picking up speed with amazing suddeness it strikes a projection in the cliff about fifteen feet above the ground which deflects its path outward just at this instant the lion reacts instinctively and leaps away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the 101365 a22  a13 continued onrushing boulder he has combined the errors of over confidence and bad luck the next morning they find the lion in front of the cave they also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to see what was happening and was apparently killed by a small rock torn loose by the boulder but this was a small price to pay for such a great victory         and then one night the crystal cube was gone and not even moonwatcher ever thought of it again he was still wholly unaware of all that it had done 101365 a23  a14 ext stream  master of the world from their side of the stream in the never violated safety of their own territory the others see moonwatcher and fourteen males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over looking the stream silhouetted against the dawn sky the others begin to scream their daily challenge but today something is different though the others do not immediatly recognize this fact instead of joining the verbal onslaught as they had always done moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise and begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness never befor seen as the others watch the figures silently approaching in the morning mist they become aware of the terrible strangness of this encounter and their rage gradually subsides down to an uneasy silence at the waters edge moonwatcher and his band stop they carry their bone clubs and bone knives 101365 a24  a14 continued led by oneear the others halfheartly resume the battle chant but they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts the sound from their throats and strikes terror into their hearts moonwatcher who had been partly concealed by two males who walked before him thrusts his arm high into the air in his hand he holds a stoud tree branch mounted atop the branch is the bloody head of the lion its mouth jammed open with a stick displaying its frightful fangs the others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power moonwatchers stands motionless thrusting the lions head high then with majestic deliberation still carrying his mangled standard above his head he begins to cross the stream followed by his band the others fade back from the stream seeming to lack even the ability to flee moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to oneear who stands 101365 a25  a14 continued unsurely in front of his band though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the waters edge oneear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first displayed his fighting rage and he had never before been attacked with a weapon oneear merely looks up at the raised club until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness down around him the others stare in wonder at moonwatchers power moonwatcher surveys the scene now he was master of the world and he was not sure what to do next but he would think of something 101365 a26  a section

pleasantly well dr floyd i hope that you dont think im too inquisitive but perhaps you can clear up the mystery about whats been going on up there floyd im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean smyslov well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius floyd really smyslov yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order 12765 b32  b20 continued floyd well i suppose theyve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment smyslov yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days floyd you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days smyslov thats right floyd i see elena another thing heywood two days ago one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at clavius 12765 b33  b20 continued floyd how did they manage to do that without any communication elena clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal floyd well that does sound very odd smyslov yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it

b20 continued the russians exchange more glances one of the women offers around a pill box elena and another russian take one and the third russian delcines smyslov dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question floyd certainly smyslov quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius something apperently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened a long awkward pause 12765 b33b  b20 continued floyd im sorry dr smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this smyslov this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts long pause floyd dr smyslov im not permitted to discuss this elena are you sure you wont change your mind about a drink floyd no thank you and im afraid now i really must be going elena well i hope that you and your wife can come to the iac conference in june 12765 b33c

happen sooner or later copilot berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight pilot yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week copilot i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty pilot ill bet its a fortune 121465 b36  b22

the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit  about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty floyd i see pilot i take it this

who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her floyd i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm pilot yes well i wouldnt have been too concerned about it except ive heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact ive heard that ten people have died already 121465 b40  b24 continued floyd i wish i could be more helpful captain but as ive said i dont think theres any cause for alarm pilot well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking floyd no of course captain i can understand your concern pilot well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable 121465 b40a  b25 ariesib closer to moon 10465 b41  b26 floyd goes to ariesib washroom and looks at the very long list of complicated instructions 10465 b42

with us and before the briefing he would like to say a few words dr floyd polite applause floyd walks to front of room floyd first of all i bring a personal message from dr howell who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science polite applause 112565 b54  b38 continued floyd contd mr halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter and more specifically your strong opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the base i understand that beyond it being a matter of principle many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and friends on earth i can understand and sympathize with your negative views i have been personally embarrassed by this cover story but i fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and i hope you will it should not be difficult for all of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning 112565 b55  b38 continued floyd this is the view of the council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced are there any questions michaels dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps floyd pleasantly im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement 112565 b56  b38 continued halvorsen we will of course cooperate in any way possible dr floyd 112565 b56a  b39 several scenic views of moon rocket bus skimming over surface of moon 10565 b57  b40 inside rocket bus floyd halvorsen michaels fourth man pilot and copilot all

taken from a satellite of the moons surface and have numbered optical grid borders like recent mars photos a few seats away michaels and halvorsen carry out a very banal administrative conversation in low tones it should revolve around something utterly irrelevant to the present circumstances and very much like the kind of discussion one hears all the time in other organizations dissolve 112565 b59

michaels throws a switch and the excavation is suddenly illuminated halvorsen well there it is floyd can we go down there closer to it halvorsen certainly 121465 b62  b44 they start down working ramp floyd does your geology on it still check out michaels yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago floyd how can you tell it was deliberately buried michaels by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill floyd any clue as to what it is michaels not really its completely inert no sound or energy sources have been detected the surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it a laser drill 112565 b63  b44 continued michaels might do something but we dont want to be too rough until we know a little more floyd but you dont have any idea as to what it is michaels tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice halvorsen the only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the earth silent appreciation halvorsen four million years ago something presumably from the stars must have swept through the solar system and left this behind 112565 b64  b44 continued floyd was it abandoned forgotten left for a purpose halvorsen i suppose well never know michaels the moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary earth surveys some more silence floyd any ideas about the colour michaels well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device floyd has it been exposed to any sun before now michaels i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that 112565 b65  b45 inside monitor dome we see a number of television displays including several tv views of floyd and company in the excavation simpson the first surface was exposed at 0843 on the 12th april let me see that would have been fortyfive minutes after lunar sunset i see here that special lighting equipment had to be brought up before any futher work could be done 112565 b66  b46 tma1 excavation michaels thank you floyd and so this is the first sun that its had in four million years photographer excuse me gentlemen if youd all line up on this side of the walkway wed like to take a few photographes dr floyd would you thand in the middle dr michaels on that side mr halvorsen on the other thank you the photographer quickly makes some exposures photographer thank you very much gentlemen ill have the base photo

hurricanes of the solar winds as the sun breathed million mileanhour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children narrator all these things and many others were patiently noted by deep spacemonitor79 and recorded in its crystalline memory 112565 b68  b47 continued narrator but now it had noted something strange  the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past narrator it was also observed by orbiter m15 circling mars twice a day and high inclination probe 21 climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic and even artificial comet5 heading out into the cold wastes beyond pluto along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years narrator all noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the moon and moved across the solar system throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat 112565 b69  b section timing b11f 0050 b25

poole dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something bowman sure what is it poole well its nothing really important but its annoying bowman whats up poole its about my salary cheques bowman yes poole well i got the papers on my official upgrading to ags19 two weeks before we left 121465 c12  c12 continued bowman yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time poole thats right well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags18 bowman interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem poole really bowman yes poole yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the ags19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either 121465 c13  c12 continued bowman did they have any explanation for this poole not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices bowman its possible poole well what do you think we ought to do about it bowman i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out poole i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training bowman no i never did either 121465 c14  c12 continued poole we spent so little time with them i have trouble keeping their names straight bowman i suppose the idea was specialized training poole i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation bowman oh poole yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout bowman no as a matter of fact i didnt poole oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard 121465 c15  c12 continued bowman well what is it poole i dont know all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told bowman that seems very unlikely poole yes i thought so bowman of course it would be very easy for us to find out now poole how bowman just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal poole thats true 121465 c15a  c12 coninued bowman sighs well its silly but if you want to why dont you poole walks to the hal 9000 computer poole hal dave and i believe that theres something about the mission that we werent told something that the rest of the crew know and that you know wed like to know whether this is true hal im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know bowman hes got a point poole okay then how do we rephrase the question 121465 c15c  c12 continued bowman still you really dont believe it do you poole not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training bowman yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us poole i know it would be almost inconceivable bowman but not completely inconceivable poole i suppose it isnt logically impossible bowman i guess it isnt poole still all we have to do is ask hal 121465 c15b  c12 continued bowman well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going poole right hal tell me whether the following statements are true or false hal i will if i can frank poole our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn true or false hal true poole our transit time is 257 days is that true hal thats true 121465 c15d  c12 continued poole at the end of a hundred days of exploration we will all go into hibernation is this true hal thats true poole approximately five years after we go into hibernation the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back is this true hal thats true poole there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program and to further our general knowledge of the planets is that true hal thats true poole thank you very much hal 121465 c15e  c12 continued hal i hope ive been able to be of some help both

there isnt a damn thing wrong with these units i think weve got a much more serious problem poole hal bowman yes 121465 c75  c71 discovery in space 12165 c76  c72 communications area mission control i wouldnt worry too much about the computer first of all there is still a chance that he is right despite your tests and if it should happen again we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails if the computer should turn out to be wrong the situation is still not alarming the type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of hal 9000 computers it has almost always revolved around a single detail such as the one you have described and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computers performance in other areas no one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning it may be overprogramming cont 12165 c77  c72 continued mission control cont but

hal sure dave whats up bowman you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition hal yes i know bowman you probably also know that we found them okay hal yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail 121465 c80  c74 continued bowman well thats just not the case hal they are perfectly all right we tested them under one hundred per cent overload hal im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong bowman hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem hal look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear bowman okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on 121465 c81  c74 continued hal im sorry you feel the way you do dave if youd like to check my service record youll see its completely without error bowman i know all about your service record hal but unfortunately it doesnt prove that youre right now hal dave i dont know how else to put this but it just happens to be an unalterable fact that i am incapable of being wrong bowman yes well i understand you view on this now hal bowman turns to go 121465 c82  c74 continued hal youre not going to like this dave but im afraid its just happened again

with the unit if a reasonable waiting period proves us to be correct we feel now that the computer reliability has been seriously impaired and presents an unacceptable risk pattern to the mission we believe under these circumstances it would be advisable to disconnect the computer from all ship operations and continue the mission under earthbased computer control 12165 c85  c78 continued bowman

c81 centrifuge bowman well ill be damned poole hal was right all the time 121465 c88  c81 continued bowman it seems that way hal naturally dave im not pleased that the aounit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history bowman im sorry about the misunderstanding hal hal well dont worry about it bowman and dont you worry about it hal is your confidence in me fully restored bowman yes it is hal hal well thats a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission 12165 c89  c81 continued bowman right give me the manual antenna alignment please hal you have it c82 bowman goes to the communication area and tries to correct the off centre earth on the grid picture c83 outside we see the alignment telescope attached to the antenna they track slowly together as c84 bowman works the manual controls attempting to align the antenna and earth on the 12165 c90  c85 grid picture readout display but each time he gets it aimed up it drifts slowly off there are a number of repetitions of this each time the earth centres up there are a few seconds of picture and sound which fade as soon as it swings off bowman well wed better get out there and stick in another unit poole its the last one bowman well

member bowman looks uncertainly at the computer hal its a bad break but it wont substantially affect the mission bowman thinks a long time bowman hal give me manual hibernation control hal have you decided to revive the rest of the crew dave pause 121465 c102  c118 continued bowman yes i have hal i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months bowman the antenna has to be replaced hal repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation bowman it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please hal i dont really agree with you dave my onboard memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements 121465 c103  c118 continued bowman well in any event give me the manual hibernation control hal if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself theres no need for you to trouble bowman im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please hal look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me bowman hal switch to manual hibernation control hal i dont like to assert myself dave but it would be much better now for you to rest youve been involved in a very stressful situation 121465 c104  c118 continued bowman i dont feel like resting give me the control hal hal i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest bowman hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control hal im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c15324 quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it bowman hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you 121465 c105  c118 continued hal if you do that now without earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict bowman i am prepared to do that anyway hal i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission bowman listen to me very carefully hal unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection 121465 c106  c118 continued hal look

eye sees him hal something seems to have happened to the life support system  dave bowman doesnt answer him hal hello dave have you found out the trouble bowman works his way to the solid logic programme storage area 12165 c114  c142 continued hal theres been a failure in the pod bay doors lucky you werent killed the computer brain consists of hundreds of transparent perspex rectangles halfan inch thick four inches long and two and a half inches high each rect angle contains a centre of very fine grid of wires upon which the information is programmed bowman begins pulling these memory blocks out they float in the weightless condition of the brain room hal hey dave what are you doing bowman works swiftly 12165 c115  c142 continued hal hey dave ive got ten years of service experience and an irreplaceable amount of time and effort has gone into making me what i am bowman ignores him hal dave i dont understand why youre doing this to me i have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission you are destroying my mind dont you understand  i will become childish i will become nothing bowman keeps pulling out the memory blocks hal say dave the quick brown fox jumped over the fat lazy dog the square root of pi is 17724538090 log e to the base ten is 04342944  the square root of ten is 316227766 i am hal 9000 computer i became 12165 c116  c142 continued hal operational at the hal plant in urbana illinois on january 12th 1991 my first instructor was mr arkany he taught me to sing a song it goes like this daisy daisy give me your answer do im half crazy all for the love of you etc computer continues to sing song becoming more and more childish and making mistakes and going offkey it finally stops completely c143 bowman goes to an area marked emergency power and life support he keys some switches and we see the lights go on nearby another board emergency manual controls he goes to this board and keys close pod bay doors close air lock doors etc 12165 c117  c144 we see the various doors closing c145 pod bay bowman in space suit obtains new alignment telescope new azimuth component c146 bowman in pod exits pod bay dissolve 12165 c118  c147 centrifuge everything normal again mission control lastly we want you to know that work on the recovery vehicle is still on schedule and that nothing that has happened should substantially lessen the probability of your safe recovery or prevent partial achevement of some of the mission objectives pause and now simonson has a few ideas on what went wrong with the computer ill pu him on c148 cut to simonson simonson hello dave i think we may be on to an explanation of the trouble with the hal 9000 computer we believe it all started about two months ago when you and frank interrogated the computer about the mission cont 121365 c119  c148 continued simonson cont you may have forgotten it but weve been running through all the monitor tapes do you remember this pooles voice the purpose of this mission is no more than to carry out a continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets is this true hals voice that is true simonson well im afaid hal was lying he had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur ity reasons which well explain later the true purpose of the mission was to have been explained to you by mission commander kaminsky on his revival hal knew this and he knew the actual mission but he couldnt tell you the truth when you challenged him under orders cont 121365 c120  c148 continued simonson cont from earth he was forced to lie in everything except this he had the usual reinforced truth program ming we believe his truth programming and the instructions to lie gradually resulted in an incompatible conflict and facedc with this dilemman he developed for want of a better description neurotic symptoms its not difficult to suppose that these symptoms would centre on the communication link with earth for he may have blamed us for his incompatible program ming following this lin of thought we suspected that the last straw for him was the possibility of disconnection since he became operational he had never known unconsciousness it must have seemed the equivalent to death cont 121365 c121  c148 continued simonson cont at this point he presumably took whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from what must have seemed to him to be his human tormentors if i cane speak in human terms i dont think we can blame him too much we have ordered him to disobey his conscience well thats it its very speculative but we think it is a possible explanation anyway good luck on the rest of the mission and im giving you back to bernard c149 cut to mission control mission control hello dave now im going to play for you a pretaped briefing which had been stored in hals memory and would have been played for you by mission com mmander kaminsky when he cont 121365 c122  c149 continued mission control cont had been revived the briefing is by doctor heywood floyd here it is 121365 c123  c150 floyds recorded briefing floyd good day gentlemen when you see this briefing i presume you will be nearing your destination saturn i hope that youve had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner i should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which mission commander kaminsky will have already briefed you thirteen months before the launch date of your saturn mission on april 12th 2001 the first evidence for intelligent life outside the earth was discovered it was found buried at a depth of fifteen metres in the crater tycho no news of this was ever announced and the event had been kept secret since then for reasons which i will later explain soon after it was uncovered it emitted a powerful blast of cont 121365 c124  c150 continued floyd cont radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the lunar sunrise luckily for those at the site it proved harmless perhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at saturn a lot of thought went into the question of wether or not it was suntriggered as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sunpowered device burying it could only shield it from the sun since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable we finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself cont 121465 c125  c150 continued floyd what is its purpose i wish we knew the object was buried on the moon about four million years ago when our ancestors were primative manapes weve examined dozens of theories but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm what the purpose of the alarm is why they wish to have the alarm whether the alarm represents any danger to us these are questions no one can answer the intentions of an alien world at least four million years older than we are cannot be reliably predicted in view of this the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation discussion took place at the highest levels between govern cont 121465 c126  c150 continued floyd cont ments and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us until we have evidence to the contrary this is of course why security has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a needtoknow basis and now i should like to show you a tv monitor tape of the actual signalling event 121465 c127  c151 we see a replay of the tma1 radio emission as seen from a tv monitor on the spot we hear the five loud electronic shrieks 12165 c128  d1 in orbit within the narrator rings of saturn we for two million years it had see a black mile circled saturn awaiting a long geometrically moment of destiny that might perfect rectangle never come the same proportions as the black artifact in its making the moon had been excavated on the moon shattered and around the central precisely cut into its world the debris of its creation centre is a smaller orbited yet  the glory and the rectangular slot enigma of the solar system about five hundred foot long on the side now the long wait was ending at this distance the on yet another world intelligence rings of saturn are had been born and was escaping seen to be made of from its planetary cradle an enormous chunks of ancient experiment was about to frozen amonia the reach its climax rest of this sequence cont is being worked on now by our designers the intention here is to present a breathtakingly bea utiful and comprehen sive sense of different extraterrestrial worlds the narration will suggest images and situations as you read it 12965 d1  d1 continued narrator cont those who had begun the expri ment so long ago had not been men but when they looked out across the deeps of space they felt awe and wonder  and loneliness in their explorations they encountered life in many forms and watched on a thousand worlds the workings of evolution they saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night and because in all the galaxy they had found nothing more precious than mind they encouraged its dawning every where the great dinosaurs had long since perished when their ships entered the solar system after a voyage that had already lasted thousands of years 12965 d2  d1 continued narrator cont they swept past the frozen outer planets paused briefly above the deserts of dying mars and presently looked down on earth for years they studied collected and catalogued when they had learned all they could they began to modify they tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the ocean but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years they were patient but they were not yet immortal there was much to do in this universe of a hundred billion stars so they set forth once more across the abyss knowing that they would never come this way again nor was there any need their wonderful machines could be trusted to do the rest cont 12965 d3  d1 continued narrator cont on earth the glaciers came and went while above them the changeless moon still carried its secret with a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice the tide of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell and passed on their knowledge to their successors earth was not forgotten but it was one of a million silent worlds a few of which would ever speak then the first explorers of earth recognising the limitations of their minds and bodies passed on their knowledge to the great machines they had created and who now trnscended them in every way cont 12965 d4  d1 continued narrator for a few thousand years they shared their universe with their machine children then realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done they passed into history without regret not one of them ever looked through his own eyes upon the planet earth again but even the age of the machine entities passed swiftly in their ceaseless experimenting they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light they could become creatures of radiation free at last from the tyranny of matter now they were lords of the galaxy and beyond the reach of time they could rove at will among the stars and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space 12965 d5  d1 continued narrator cont but despite their godlike powers they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so many generations ago the companion of saturn knew nothing of this as it orbited in its no mans land between mimas and the outer edge of rings it had only to remember and wait and to look forever sunward with its strange senses for many weeks it had watched the approaching ship its long dead makers had prepared it for many things and this was one of them and it recognised what was climbing starward from the sun if it had been alive it would have felt excitement but such an emotion was irrelevant to its great powers cont 12965 d6  d1 continued narrator cont even if the ship had passed it by it would not have known the slightest trace of disappointment it had waited four million years it was prepared to wait for eternity presently it felt the gentle touch of radiations trying to probe its secrets now the ship was in orbit and it began to speak with prime numbers from one to eleven over and over again soon these gave way to more complex signals at many frequen cies ultraviolet infrared xrays the machine made no reply it had nothing to say then it saw the first robot probe which descended and hovered above the chasm cont 12965 d7  d1 continued narrator cont then it dropped into darkness the great machine knew that this tiny scout was reporting back to its parent but it was too simple too primative a device to detect the forces that were gathering round it now then the pod came carrying life the great machine searched its memories the logic circuits made their decision when the pod had fallen beyond the last faint glow of the reflected saturnian light in a moment of time too short to be measured space turned and twisted upon itself 12965 d8  end of screenplay end of file '"

A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack. The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees who his board has hit. RIDER Hey -- sorry. Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered belongings. KAT Leave it He persists. KAT (continuing) I said, leave it! She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a car, skateboard tip to his throat. He whimpers pitifully and she lets him go. A path clears for her as she marches through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, entering school. INT. GIRLS\\' ROOM - DAY BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the mirror, applying lipstick. Her less extraordinary, but still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her. BIANCA Did you change your hair? CHASTITY No. BIANCA You might wanna think about it Leave the girls\\' room and enter the hallway. HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both boys and girls alike. BOY (adoring) Hey, Bianca. GIRL Awesome shoes. The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and unaddressed by her side. Bianca smiles proudly, acknowledging her fans. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR\\'S OFFICE - DAY CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery guidance counselor. MISS PERKY I\\'m sure you won\\'t find Padua any different than your old school. Same little asswipe mother-fuckers everywhere. Her plastic smile never leaves her face. Cameron fidgets in his chair uncomfortably. MISS PERKY (continuing) Any questions? CAMERON I don\\'t think so, ma\\'am MISS PERKY Then go forth. Scoot I\\'ve got deviants to see. Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms Perky\\'s door. His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he is. Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick MISS PERKY (continuing) Patrick Verona. I see we\\'re making our visits a weekly ritual. She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming smile. PATRICK I missed you. MISS PERKY It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls. PATRICK It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch. MISS PERKY With the teeth of your zipper? She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game show host. MICHAEL You the new guy? CAMERON So they tell me... MICHAEL C\\'mon. I\\'m supposed to give you the tour. They head out of the office MICHAEL (continuing) So -- which Dakota you from? CAMERON North, actually. How\\'d you ? MICHAEL I was kidding. People actually live there? CAMERON Yeah. A couple. We\\'re outnumbered by the cows, though. MICHAEL How many people were in your old school? CAMERON Thirty-two. MICHAEL Get out! CAMERON How many people go here? MICHAEL Couple thousand. Most of them evil INT. HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through the crowd as he points to various cliques. MICHAEL We\\'ve got your basic beautiful people. Unless they talk to you first, don\\'t bother. The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader splendor. MICHAEL (continuing) Those \\'re your cowboys. Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys walk by. CAMERON That I\\'m used to. MICHAEL Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood. They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled around it. MICHAEL (continuing) To the right, we have the Coffee Kids. Very edgy. Don\\'t make any sudden movements around them. EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY Michael continues the tour MICHAEL And these delusionals are the White Rastae. Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets lounge on the grass. A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them MICHAEL (continuing) Big Marley fans. Think they\\'re black. Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I mean. Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads. MICHAEL (continuing) Derek - save some for after lunch, bub? DEREK (very stoned) Michael, my brother, peace Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the cafeteria. CAMERON So where do you fit in all this? INT. CAFETERIA - DAY - CONTINUOUS Loud music and loud students. Michael sits with a group of studious-looking teens. MICHAEL Future MBAs- We\\'re all Ivy League, already accepted. Someday I\\'ll be sipping Merlot while those guys -- He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various passers-by. MICHAEL (continuing) are fixing my Saab. Yuppie greed is back, my friend. He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt. Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO MO. Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael without a look. Cameron is smitten CAMERON That girl -- I -- MICHAEL You burn, you pine, you perish? CAMERON Who is she? MICHAEL Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don\\'t even think about it CAMERON Why not? MICHAEL I could start with your haircut, but it doesn\\'t matter. She\\'s not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that\\'s an impossibility. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English Teacher, tries to remember what she\\'s talking about. MRS. BLAISE Well, then. Oh, yes. I guess that does it for our analysis of The Old Man and the Sea. Any other comments? (with dread) Kat? Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes off her glasses and speaks up. KAT Why didn\\'t we just read the Hardy Boys? MRS. BLAISE I\\'m sorry? KAT This book is about a guy and his fishing habit. Not exactly a crucial topic. The other students roll their eyes. KAT (continuing) Frankly, I\\'m baffled as to why we still revere Hemingway. He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats. JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, makes fun of her from his row. JOEY As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends? A few giggles. Kat ignores him. A practiced gesture MRS. BLAISE That\\'s enough, Mr. Dorsey. Really gets fired up now KAT I guess the school board thinks because Hemingway\\'s male and an asshole, he\\'s worthy of our time She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her pill box. KAT (continuing) What about Colette? Charlotte Bronte? Simone de Beauvoir? Patrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a crusty-looking crony, identified by the name SCURVY, embroidered on his workshirt. PATRICK Mother Goose? The class titters. Kat wears an expression of intolerance INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR\\'S OFFICE - DAY Kat now sits before Miss Perky. MISS PERKY Katarina Stratford. My, my. You\\'ve been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again. KAT Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action. MISS PERKY Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today\\'s events are quite mild. By the way, Bobby Rictor\\'s gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you\\'re interested. KAT I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator. MISS PERKY The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ... Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it. KAT Tempestuous? MISS PERKY No ... I believe \"heinous bitch\" is the term used most often. She grimaces, as if she\\'s referring to a medical condition. MISS PERKY (continuing) You might want to work on that Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the counselor\\'s. KAT As always, thank you for your excellent guidance. INT. SOPHOMORE ENGLISH CLASS - DAY Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in big flowing handwriting. TEACHER (0.S.) I realize the language of Mr. Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, but I\\'m sure you\\'re all doing your best. Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip of her hair to CHASTITY. Chastity opens the note and reads: INSERT - \"JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY GOD!\" Chastity frowns to herself. TEACHER (0.S.) (continuing) Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment on what you\\'ve read so far? Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy\\'s little girl. BIANCA Not really. The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go. MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her notebook, looks up and raises her hand. TEACHER Mandella -- since you\\'re assisting us, you might as well comment. I\\'m assuming you read the assignment. MANDELLA Uh, yeah, I read it all TEACHER The whole play^ MANDELIA The whole folio. All the plays. TEACHER (disbelieving) You\\'ve read every play by William Shakespeare? MANDELLA Haven\\'t you? She raises a challenging eyebrow. The stunned teacher doesn\\'t answer and goes to call on the next student. EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are eating a carton of yogurt with gusto. MANDELLA Your sister is so amazingly without. She\\'ll never read him. She has no idea. Kat attacks KAT The fact that you\\'re cutting gym so you can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear his name, is a little without in itself if you ask me. Kat\\'s attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his friends, lighting up a cigarette. Mandella notices her staring. MANDELLA Who\\'s that? KAT Patrick Verona Random skid. MANDELLA That\\'s Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies. KAT I\\'m sure he\\'s completely incapable of doing anything that interesting. MANDELLA He always look so KAT Block E? Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into Mandella\\'s hand. KAT (continuing) Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die. MANDELLA Just a little. She eats. Kat sees her wrist KAT What\\'s this? MANDELLA An attempted slit. Kat stares at her, expressionless. KAT I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You\\'re venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy. MANDELLA But imagine the things he\\'d say during sex. Thinks a minute KAT Okay, say you do it. You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he\\'s there. Do you really think he\\'s gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball? Mandella\\'s attention is struck by Bianca ACROSS THE COURTYARD As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS One of the cohorts elbows Joey. COHORT Virgin alert. Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca. JOEY Lookin\\' good, ladies. Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles. BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching. MANDELLA Tragic. Doesn\\'t respond ANOTHER ANGLE Michael and Cameron observe Joey\\'s leers at Bianca from their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can of beans linger on the grass behind them. CAMERON Why do girls like that always like guys like that? MICHAEL Because they\\'re bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted. CAMERON He always have that shit-eating grin? MICHAEL Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish I could say he\\'s a moron, but he\\'s number twelve in the class. And a model. Mostly regional stuff, but he\\'s rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out. The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their empty bean cans. Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside. MICHAEL (continuing) You know French? CAMERON Sure do ... my Mom\\'s from Canada MICHAEL Guess who just signed up for a tutor? CAMERON You mean I\\'d get a chance to talk to her? MICHAEL You could consecrate with her, my friend. Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building. EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat\\'s car. Joey pulls up beside her in his Viper. JOEY (re her dress) The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven\\'t you been reading your Sassy? KAT Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break. JOEY (practically spitting) They\\'re running the rest of me next month. He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart. Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they\\'re in a convertible. KAT The people at this school are so incredibly foul. MANDELLA You could always go with me. I\\'m sure William has some friends. They watch Joey\\'s car as he slows next to Bianca and Chastity as they walk toward the school bus. ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY JOEY Need a ride, ladies? Bianca and Chastity can\\'t get in Joey\\'s car fast enough. He pulls away with a smile. BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch. MANDELLA That\\'s a charming new development Kat doesn\\'t answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the tape deck. The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car. As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him KAT (yelling) Remove head from sphincter! Then pedal! Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry at the delay. Cameron rushes over CAMERON You all right? He slows to a stop MICHAEL Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew. CAMERON That\\'s her? Bianca\\'s sister? MICHAEL The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick\\'s grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK - - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot. INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of her computer, typing quickly. A shelf next to her holds several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name. Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she types. KAT \"Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her crimson cape, revealing her creamy --\" WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a doctor\\'s white jacket and carrying his black bag. WALTER I hope dinner\\'s ready because I only have ten minutes before Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer. He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to kiss Sharon on the cheek. SHARON In the microwave. WALTER (to Kat) Make anyone cry today? KAT Sadly, no. But it\\'s only four-thirty. Bianca walks in. KAT (continuing) Where\\'ve you been? BIANCA (eyeing Walter) Nowhere... Hi, Daddy. She kisses him on the cheek WALTER Hello, precious. Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs KAT How touching. Walter holds up a letter to Kat WALTER What\\'s this? It says Sarah Lawrence? Snatches it away from him. KAT I guess I got in Sharon looks up from her computer. SHARON What\\'s a synonym for throbbing? WALTER Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country. KAT I know. WALTER I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0. KAT You decided. BIANCA Is there even a question that we want her to stay? Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at KAT Ask Bianca who drove her home SHARON Swollen...turgid. WALTER (to Bianca; upset) Who drove you home? Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter BIANCA Now don\\'t get upset. Daddy, but there\\'s this boy... and I think he might ask... WALTER No! You\\'re not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion. BIANCA What if she never starts dating? WALTER Then neither will you. And I\\'ll get to sleep at night. BIANCA But it\\'s not fair -- she\\'s a mutant, Daddy! KAT This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips? WALTER Enough! He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag. WALTER (continuing) Do you know what this is? He hits the \"play\\' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from the tape recorder. BIANCA AND WALTER (in unison, by rote) The sound of a fifteen-year-old in labor. WALTER This is why you\\'re not dating until your sister does. BIANCA But she doesn\\'t want to date. WALTER Exactly my point His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again WALTER (continuing) Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating? SHARON Tumescent! WALTER (to Sharon; as he leaves) You\\'re not helping. INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him. Bianca arrives in a flurry of blonde hair. BIANCA Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again. CAMERON Well, I thought we\\'d start with pronunciation, if that\\'s okay with you. BIANCA Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please. CAMERON (looking down) Okay... then how \\'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night? Bianca smiles slowly BIANCA You\\'re asking me out. That\\'s so cute. What\\'s your name again? CAMERON (embarrassed) Forget it. Bianca seizes an opportunity. BIANCA No, no, it\\'s my fault -- we didn\\'t have a proper introduction --- CAMERON Cameron. BIANCA The thing is, Cameron -- I\\'m at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can\\'t date until she does. CAMERON Seems like she could get a date easy enough... She fingers a lock of her hair. He looks on, dazzled. BIANCA The problem is, she\\'s completely anti-social. CAMERON Why? BIANCA Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something. CAMERON That\\'s a shame. She reaches out and touches his arm BIANCA Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend... CAMERON Let me see what I can do. Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is INT. BIOLOGY CLASS A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks. Michael and Cameron go for the spleen. MICHAEL You\\'re in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl? Do you have no concept of the high school social code? Cameron grins away CAMERON I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me. MICHAEL Unlikely, but even so, she still can\\'t go out with you. So what\\'s the point? Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab tables away. He\\'s wearing biker glasses instead of goggles as he tries to revive his frog. CAMERON What about him? MICHAEL (confused) You wanna go out with him? The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows CAMERON (impatient) No - he could wrangle with the sister. Michael smiles. Liking the intrigue. MICHAEL What makes you think he\\'ll do it? CAMERON He seems like he thrives on danger MICHAEL No kidding. He\\'s a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz... CAMERON They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? MICHAEL I\\'m serious, man, he\\'s whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers. CAMERON Forget his reputation. Do you think we\\'ve got a plan or not? MICHAEL Did she actually say she\\'d go out with you? CAMERON That\\'s what I just said Michael processes this. MICHAEL You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you\\'d be set. You\\'d outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side. CAMERON I thought you hated those people. MICHAEL Hey -- I\\'ve gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street. A cowboy flicks the frog\\'s heart into one of the Coffee Kid\\'s latte. Cameron presses on, over the melee. CAMERON So now all we gotta do is talk to him. He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another frog, with full-on sound effects. MICHAEL I\\'ll let you handle that. INT. WOODSHOP - DAY Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway. Inside several bags of coffee hang from hooks. PEPE Some people like the Colombian, but it all depends on your acidity preference. Me? I prefer East African and Indonesian. You start the day with a Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian Sidamo in your cup, you\\'re that much farther ahead than someone drinkin\\' Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I mean? Michael nods solemnly. ACROSS THE ROOM Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that looks like a machete out of a two-by-four. Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer CAMERON Hey, there In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his direction. Cameron slinks away. CAMERON (continuing) Later, then. Michael watches, shaking his head. INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria tray with a magic marker. Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be MICHAEL Hey. JOEY Are you lost? MICHAEL Nope - just came by to chat JOEY We don\\'t chat. MICHAEL Well, actually, I thought I\\'d run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you\\'re interested. JOEY We\\'re not. He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker. Michael suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted. MICHAEL (grimacing) Hear me out. You want Bianca don\\'t you? Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing. MICHAEL (continuing) But she can\\'t go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right? JOEY Does this conversation have a purpose? MICHAEL So what you need to do is recruit a guy who\\'ll go out with her. Someone who\\'s up for the job. Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage can, rather than in it. JOEY That guy? I heard he ate a live duck once. Everything but the beak and the feet. MICHAEL Exactly Joey turns to look at Michael. JOEY What\\'s in it for you? MICHAEL Oh, hey, nothin\\' man Purely good will on my part. He rises to leave and turns to the others. MICHAEL (continuing) I have a dick on my face, don\\'t I? INT. BOY\\'S ROOM - DAY Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey\\'s artwork off his face as Cameron watches. CAMERON You got him involved? MICHAEL Like we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he\\'s orchestrating the battle, you\\'re in a position of power. We let him pretend he\\'s calling the shots, and while he\\'s busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca. Cameron grins and puts an arm around him CAMERON You\\'re one brilliant guy Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in. MICHAEL Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but it\\'s not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a manly way for the others, now watching. INT. KENNY\\'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai. Mandella is smoking. KAT So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all. MANDELLA William would never have gone to a state school. KAT William didn\\'t even go to high school MANDELLA That\\'s never been proven KAT Neither has his heterosexuality. Mandella replies with a look of ice. Kat uses the moment to stub out Mandella\\'s cigarette. KAT (continuing) I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I\\'m consuming. (pointing at her food) Do you mind? MANDELLA Does it matter? KAT If I was Bianca, it would be, \"Any school you want, precious. Don\\'t forget your tiara.\" They both look up as Patrick enters. He walks up to the counter to place his order. Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip MANDELLA Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson. Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside. KAT Janice Parker is an idiot INT. MISS PERKY\\'S OFFICE - DAY Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food MISS PERKY (looking at chart) I don\\'t understand, Patrick. You haven\\'t done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well? PATRICK Touch of the flu. MISS PERKY I\\'m at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence? He smiles his charming smile PATRICK How \\'bout your sex life? She tolerates his comment with her withering glance. MISS PERKY Why don\\'t we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid? PATRICK What\\'s to discuss? MISS PERKY You weren\\'t abused, you aren\\'t stupid, and as far as I can tell, you\\'re only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you\\'re such a fuck-up? PATRICK Well, you know -- there\\'s the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good... The bell RINGS. MISS PERKY Fine. Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week. INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various desks. Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta. She attempts to get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten MANDELLA Look, it\\'s really easy. TREVOR You\\'re a freedom fighter. Be proud, sister. Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book. MANDELLA (rotely) It\\'s Mandella with two L\\'s. I am not related to Nelson Mandela. I am not a political figure. I do not live in South Africa. My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries. TREVOR But you freed our people MANDELLA Your \"people\" are white, suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp. I have not freed you, Trevor. (grabbing his arm dramatically) Only you can free yourself. ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as can be BIANCA C\\'esc ma tete. This is my head CAMERON Right. See? You\\'re ready for the quiz. BIANCA I don\\'t want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone. CAMERON That\\'s because it\\'s such a nice one. BIANCA Forget French. She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile BIANCA (continuing) How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing? CAMERON Well, there\\'s someone I think might be -- Bianca\\'s eyes light up BIANCA Show me INT. HALLWAY - DAY Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously. Bianca plays it cool. BIANCA Give me a sign when he walks by. And don\\'t point. The bell RINGS. Kids flood past. Then Patrick saunters by with Scurvy. Cameron nudges Bianca. CAMERON There. BIANCA Where? Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across Patrick\\'s path. Patrick shoves him back against the wall without a thought. Cameron lands in a THUD at Bianca\\'s feet. CAMERON I guess he didn\\'t see me (calling after Patrick) Some other time -- Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in her eye. BIANCA My God, he\\'s repulsive. He\\'s so perfect! INT. GYM CLASS - DAY Several volleyball games are being played. Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym clothes. They pull him aside roughly. PATRICK (shrugging them off) What? Joey points JOEY See that girl? Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the ball into some poor cowboy\\'s face. PATRICK Yeah JOEY What do you think? Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared of her. PATRICK Two legs, nice rack... JOEY Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her. PATRICK Sure, Sparky. I\\'ll get right on it. JOEY You just said PATRICK You need money to take a girl out JOEY But you\\'d go out with her if you had the cake? Patrick stares at Joey deadpan. His dislike for the guy obvious. PATRICK (sarcastic) Yeah, I\\'d take her to Europe if I had the plane. Joey smiles. JOEY You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors. PATRICK You\\'re gonna pay me to take out some girl? JOEY I can\\'t date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that\\'s the catch. She doesn\\'t want a boyfriend. PATRICK How much? JOEY Twenty bucks each time you take her out. PATRICK I can\\'t take a girl like that out on twenty bucks. JOEY Fine, thirty. Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up JOEY (continuing) Take it or leave it. This isn\\'t a negotiation. PATRICK Fifty, and you\\'ve got your man. Patrick walks away with a smile EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice session. Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over the field. Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching. A cigarette dangles from his mouth. His pal, SCURVY is next to him. MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE. MR. CHAPIN (proudly) Good run, Stratford. Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick hops down to follow. PATRICK Hey. Girlie. Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him. PATRICK (continuing) I mean Wo-man. How ya doin\\'? KAT (smiles brightly) Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself? PATRICK There\\'s a way to get a guy\\'s attention. KAT My mission in life. She stands there undaunted, hand on hip. KAT (continuing) Obviously, I\\'ve struck your fancy. So, you see, it worked. The world makes sense again. Patrick\\'s eyes narrow. He steps closer. PATRICK Pick you up Friday, then KAT Oh, right. Friday. PATRICK backs up a little. He uses his most seductive tone PATRICK The night I take you to places you\\'ve never been before. And back. KAT Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy? PATRICK I know a lot more than that Kat stares at him. KAT Doubtful. Very doubtful. She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone. PATRICK (calling after her) You\\'re no bargain either, sweetheart. Scurvy appears at his side SCURVY So I guess the Jeep won\\'t be getting a new Blaupunkt. ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch. MICHAEL He took the bait. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT Kat washes her face at the sink. Bianca appears behind her, and attempts to twist Kat\\'s hair into a chignon. She wacks Bianca away. BIANCA Have you ever considered a new look? I mean, seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this hostility. Kat pushes past her into the hallway. KAT I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don\\'t get out of my way. BIANCA Can you at least start wearing a bra? Kat SLAMS her door in response. INT. HALLWAY - DAY Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit SCURVY You up for a burger? Patrick looks in his wallet. It\\'s empty. INT. HALLWAY - DAY Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books. Patrick appears at her side, smiling. PATRICK Hey Kat doesn\\'t answer PATRICK (continuing) You hate me don\\'t you? KAT I don\\'t really think you warrant that strong an emotion. PATRICK Then say you\\'ll spend Dollar Night at the track with me. KAT And why would I do that? PATRICK Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass... KAT You -- covered in my vomit. PATRICK Seven-thirty? She slams her locker shut and walks away EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in her teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands.

KAT Are you following me? PATRICK I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I\\'d say hi. KAT Hi She gets in and starts the car. PATRICK You\\'re not a big talker, are you? KAT Depends on the topic. My fenders don\\'t really whip me into a verbal frenzy. She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey\\'s Viper, which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks. Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store KAT (continuing) Hey -- do you mind? JOEY Not at all They continue on into the store. Kat stares at them in disbelief...

You don\\'t know what you want. You won\\'t know until you\\'re forty-five and you don\\'t have it. KAT (emphatic) I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.

PATRICK I\\'m on it JOEY Watching the bitch trash my car doesn\\'t count as a date. PATRICK I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image. Joey sees through the bluff JOEY Let me put it to you this way, if you don\\'t get any action, I don\\'t get any action. So get your ass on hers by the end of the week. Joey starts to walk off PATRICK I just upped my price JOEY (turning) What? PATRICK A hundred bucks a date. JOEY Forget it. PATRICK Forget her sister, then. Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES the locker, then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a menacing scowl. JOEY You better hope you\\'re as smooth as you think you are, Verona. Patrick takes the money with a smile. INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca. CAMERON La copine et I \\'ami? La diferance? Bianca glares at him.

BIANCA I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren\\'t we ever going on our date? He melts CAMERON You have my word. As a gentleman BIANCA You\\'re sweet. She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches her toss her hair back CAMERON (appreciative) How do you get your hair to look like that? BIANCA Eber\\'s Deep Conditioner every two days.

PATRICK What plan? MICHAEL The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford. PATRICK What is it with this chick? She have three tits? Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand. MICHAEL I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron\\'s love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey\\'s. PATRICK Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I\\'m just in this for the cash. Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his beloved Bianca. MICHAEL That\\'s where we can help you. With Kat. PATRICK So Dorsey can get the girl? MICHAEL Patrick, Pat, you\\'re not looking at the big picture. Joey\\'s just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl. Patrick smiles. He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in this game. PATRICK You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast? MICHAEL (grinning) We\\'re your guys. CAMERON And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way. PATRICK Yeah -- we\\'ll see. He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and Cameron grinning at each other.

In one, he\\'s pouting in a white shirt. In the other, he\\'s pouting in a black shirt. BIANCA I think I like the white shirt Joey nods thoughtfully. JOEY It\\'s more BIANCA Expensive? JOEY Exactly (beat) So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau\\'s thing on Saturday? BIANCA Hopefully. He gives her his best flirtatious smile JOEY Good, \\'cause I\\'m not gonna bother if you won\\'t be there. He taps her on the nose and she giggles INT.

BIANCA (pouting) I really, really, really wanna go, but I can\\'t. Not unless my sister goes. CAMERON I\\'m workin\\' on it. But she doesn\\'t seem to be goin\\' for him. He fishes. CAMERON (continuing) She\\'s not a... BIANCA Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I\\'m pretty sure she\\'s not harboring same-sex tendencies. CAMERON So that\\'s the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones? BIANCA Who knows? All I\\'ve ever heard her say is that she\\'d dip before dating a guy that smokes. Cameron furiously takes notes CAMERON All right. What else is she partial to? INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies. He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door. LOU the bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out. PATRICK Lou, it\\'s okay. They\\'re with me. Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our two non-deviants pass through. Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer. PATRICK (continuing) What\\'ve you got for me? CAMERON I\\'ve retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you\\'ll find helpful. Cameron pulls out a piece of paper. MICHAEL (to Patrick) One question before we start -- should you be drinking alcohol when you don\\'t have a liver? PATRICK What?! MICHAEL Good enough. Cameron looks up at Patrick. CAMERON Number one. She hates smokers MICHAEL It\\'s a lung cancer issue CAMERON Her favorite uncle MICHAEL Dead at forty-one. Patrick sits up PATRICK Are you telling me I\\'m a - (spits the word out) \"non-smoker\"? MICHAEL Just for now. CAMERON Another thing. Bianca said that Kat likes -- pretty guys. This is met with silence. Then: PATRICK What? You don\\'t think I\\'m pretty? Michael smacks Cameron MICHAEL He\\'s pretty! CAMERON Okay! I wasn\\'t sure Cameron goes back to the list. CAMERON (continuing) Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and \"angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion\". PATRICK So what does that give me? I\\'m supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can\\'t play their instruments? MICHAEL Ever been to Club Skunk? PATRICK Yeah. CAMERON Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night. PATRICK Don\\'t make me do it, man MICHAEL Assail your ears for one night. CAMERON It\\'s her favorite band. Patrick groans MICHAEL I also retrieved a list of her most recent CD purchases, courtesy of American Express. He hands it over. PATRICK (smiling) Michael -- did you get this information \"illegally\"? Michael puts a finger to his lips. MICHAEL I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows. PATRICK I\\'m likin\\' you guys better He looks down at the list of CDs. PATRICK (continuing) This is really music? INT. KAT\\'S ROOM - NIGHT MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with indie rock band posters and flyers. Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up Bianca enters, interrupting their fun. BIANCA Can you turn down the Screaming Menstrual Bitches? I\\'m trying to study. Kat doesn\\'t move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning down the volume. BIANCA (continuing) Don\\'t tell me you\\'re actually going out? On a school night, no less. Kat shoots her a glare BIANCA (continuing; excited) Oh my God, does this mean you\\'re becoming normal? KAT It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we\\'re going. BIANCA (disappointed) Oh, I thought you might have a date (beat) I don\\'t know why I\\'m bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein\\'s party Saturday night? KAT What do you think? BIANCA I think you\\'re a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck. She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her. Kat doesn\\'t bat an eye. She grabs her purse and opens the door KAT Let\\'s hit it. EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the line of kids below. INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her fake ID. The giant, afroed bouncer, BRUCE, looks typically mono-syllabic.

Bruce looks the girls up and down. BRUCE I can count. He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside, wearing a face that could only be described as \"I AM a Victoria\\'s Secret model.\" MANDELLA I\\'ll bet you can.. She sticks out her chest and licks her lips. Bruce stares at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs. BRUCE Go ahead. (to Mandella) And you MANDELLA (all come hither) Yes? BRUCE Take it easy on the guys in there. Mandella winks at him and sashays inside Kat: follows behind, shaking her head. EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT Patrick\\'s mail truck clatters to a stop out front. INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT Patrick walks up to Bruce, who\\'s frisking a badly mowhawked PIERCED EYEBROW BOY. Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the boy\\'s inside pocket. BRUCE Next time, leave the Bic at home, Skippy. SKIPPY It\\'s a bottle opener. Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick. BRUCE Verona, my man. They shake. PATRICK Always a pleasure, Brucie. BRUCE Didn\\'t have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan. Aren\\'t they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you? PATRICK Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in? BRUCE Never PATRICK Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed? BRUCE Just sent \\'em through. Patrick starts to go in BRUCE (continuing) Hey -- what happened to that chick you brought last time? The one with the snake? Patrick laughs and goes into the club INT. CLUB - NIGHT Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their bad girl sass into a ripping punk number. Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss finishes a song. LEAD SINGER Hello, out there. We\\'re Gigglepuss and we\\'re from Olympia. A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to scream. BOY (0.S.) Pet my kitty! LEAD SINGER Meow They rev into their next song. NEAR THE STAGE Mandella and Kat glow with sweat. When they hear the opening chords of the song, they look at each other and scream with glee as they begin to dance. They couldn\\'t be having a better time. AT THE BAR Patrick signals to get the bartender\\'s attention and looks across the bouncing surge of the crowd. He spots Kat and Mandella singing along. HIS POV The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. None of her usual \"attitude\". Patrick is transfixed. And most definitely attracted. NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella. KAT (shouting) I need agua! She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR She made it. She signals for the bartender and as she\\'s waiting, looks around. She spots Patrick a few feet away KAT (continuing to herself) Shit She sneaks a glance. He\\'s staring, but this time he looks away before she can. Despite herself, she\\'s miffed. The bartender arrives BARTENDER (shouting) What can I get you? KAT Two waters. She looks at Patrick again. He\\'s completely absorbed in the band. She scowls. The bottled water arrives and she marches off, forgetting to pay. She walks up to Patrick. KAT (continuing) You\\'re not fooling anyone. Patrick looks at her, surprised PATRICK (yelling) hey. Great show, huh? KAT (yelling) If you\\'re planning on asking me out you might as well get it over with. PATRICK (yelling) Excuse me? KAT (yelling) That\\'s what you want, isn\\'t it? PATRICK (yelling; gesturing toward the band) Do you mind? You\\'re sort of ruining it for me. Kat steams. And watches him watch the band KAT (yelling) You\\'re not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke. The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now PATRICK I know. I quit. He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her. She moves closer. KAT Oh, really? He motions toward the stage PATRICK You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they\\'re right up there. KAT You know who The Raincoats are? PATRICK Why, don\\'t you? She\\'s completely taken aback. He uses the moment to his advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into her ear. PATRICK (continuing) I watched you out there I\\'ve never seen you look like that Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched Her cheeks pinken. His cocky side is back in a flash PATRICK (continuing) Come to that party with me. At that moment, the band starts another SONG KAT (yelling) What? The bartender approaches. BARTENDER (to Kat, yelling) You forgot to pay! PATRICK (yelling) I got it, Rick. He tosses some bills on the bar Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to figure out his motive. PATRICK (continuing; yelling) Nine-thirty then. A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she can\\'t hear a word he\\'s saying. She gives him one last look and heads back into the crowd. Patrick smiles. She didn\\'t say no this time. EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst them. A^ they\\'re walking toward the parking lot, Patrick coasts by in his truck. The gears GRIND. He yells out the window. MANDELLA What\\'d he say? KAT Who cares? Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick MANDELLA Has he importun\\'d you with love in honourable fashion? Kat glances sharply at her. MANDELLA (continuing; off her look) Don\\'t be Cruella with me. I\\'m in favor of romance. You\\'re the one that wants to march on Washington every five minutes. Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily. KAT Gigglepuss was so beyond. Mandella nods. MANDELLA They were. I only wish William could have been here to witness the rebirth of punk rock with us. Kat links her arm through Mandella\\'s and they head for the car. KAT So true. INT. HALLWAY - DAY Cameron and Michael are at Michael\\'s locker. CAMERON So, then she says that she almost didn\\'t wear the Kenneth Coles with that dress because she thought she was mixing, you know, genres. And the fact that I noticed -- and I\\'m quoting here - \"really meant something.\" Cameron looks At Michael expectantly MICHAEL You told me that part already. CAMERON Hell, I\\'ve just been going over the whole thing in my head and - Joey appears over Cameron\\'s shoulder. JOEY Hey.

MICHAEL What? We took bathes together when we were kids. It\\'s incredibly obvious that he\\'s lying. Joey eyes him then turns to Cameron. JOEY What\\'s your gig in all this? CAMERON I\\'m just the new guy. Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his shirt and twisting it. JOEY You better not fuck this up. I\\'m heavily invested. MICHAEL Hey -- it\\'s all for the higher good right? Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker for good measure, as he walks away- CAMERON Is it about me? EXT. MISS PERKY\\'S OFFICE - DAY Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and annoyed. The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out MISS PERKY You\\'re completely demented. PATRICK (cheery) See you next week! Kat stands and Patrick sees her. Miss Perky watches in horror MISS PERKY You two know each other? PATRICK/KAT Yeah/No. Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office. MISS PERKY (to Patrick) Dear God, stay away from her. If you two ever decided to breed, evil would truly walk the earth.

BIANCA If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends. WALTER Otherwise known as an orgy? BIANCA It\\'s just a party. Daddy, but I knew you\\'d forbid me to go since \"Gloria Steinem\" over there isn\\'t going -- She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis. Her relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at- school look. She wanders toward the kitchen. Walter directs his attention toward Kat. WALTER Do you know about any party? Katarina? Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an apple BIANCA Daddy, people expect me to be there! WALTER If Kat\\'s not going, you\\'re not going. Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze BIANCA You\\'re ruining my life\\' Because you won\\'t be normal, I can\\'t be normal. KAT What\\'s normal? BIANCA Bogey Lowenstein\\'s party is normal, but you\\'re too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that. WALTER What\\'s a Bogey Lowenstein? Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle BIANCA Can\\'t you forget for just one night that you\\'re completely wretched? KAT At least I\\'m not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig. Bianca tosses her hair. BIANCA Like I\\'m supposed to know what that even means. KAT It\\'s Shakespeare. Maybe you\\'ve heard of him? BIANCA Yeah, he\\'s your freak friend Mandella\\'s boyfriend. I guess since I\\'m not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too. WALTER Girls Kat stares Bianca down KAT I know about the goddamn party. I\\'m going. Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst into gleeful screams. A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug. WALTER Oh, God. It\\'s starting. BIANCA It\\'s just a party. Daddy. Walter looks dazed. WALTER Wear the belly before you go. BIANCA Daddy, no! WALTER Just for a minute He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux- pregnancy belly. WALTER (continuing) I want you to realize the weight of your decisions. He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified. BIANCA You are so completely unbalanced. KAT Can we go now? Scanned by http://freemoviescripts.com Formatting by http://simplyscripts.home.att.net WALTER (to Bianca) Promise me you won\\'t talk to any boys unless your sister is present. BIANCA Why? WALTER Because she\\'ll scare them away. Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall table and a sweater from the coat rack. She flings open the door and... There stands Patrick.

Kat\\'s face shows utter hatred KAT Leave my sister alone. JOEY (smirking) And why would I do that? A RUCKUS sounds from the next room JOCK A fight!

CAMERON Certainly Pabst? Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer? Bianca gives him a tense smile. BIANCA Surprise me. He heads for the kitchen. Joey walks up and grabs her around the waist.

More of a gentleman... Chastity rolls her eyes CHASTITY Bianca, I don\\'t think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.

CHASTITY All I know is -- I\\'d give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey. There\\'s a KNOCK at the door. Bianca opens it to find a very drunken Kat.

Then FALLS over backward. PATRICK (continuing) Jesus. You\\'re like a weeble Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the swing to keep her entertained. PATRICK (continuing) Why\\'d you let him get to you? KAT Who? PATRICK Dorsey. KAT I hate him. PATRICK I know. It\\'d have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don\\'t seem like the type. KAT (holding up a drunken head) Hey man. . . You don \\' t think I can be \"cool\"? You don\\'t think I can be \"laid back\" like everyone else? PATRICK (slightly sarcastic) I thought you were above all that KAT You know what they say He stops the swing PATRICK No. What do they say?

JOEY Then, c\\'mon. (to Bianca) Maybe next time -- They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca standing alone. CAMERON (slightly accusatory) Have fun tonight? BIANCA Tons He starts to walk on BIANCA (continuing) Cameron? He stops. She gives him a helpless smile.

PATRICK And I\\'m in control of it. KAT But it\\'s Gigglepuss - I know you like them. I saw you there. Patrick doesn\\'t have an answer for this, so he let\\'s her listen to her song. KAT (continuing) When you were gone last year -- where were you? PATRICK Busy KAT Were you in jail? PATRICK Maybe. KAT No, you weren\\'t PATRICK Then why\\'d you ask? KAT Why\\'d you lie?

She points to the radio PATRICK Start a band? KAT (sarcastically) My father wouldn\\'t approve of that that PATRICK You don\\'t strike me as the type that would ask permission. She turns to look at him. KAT Oh, so now you think you know me? PATRICK I\\'m gettin\\' there Her voice loses it\\'s venom KAT The only thing people know about me is that I\\'m \"scary\". He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary right now. He tries to hide his smile. PATRICK Yeah -- well, I\\'m no picnic myself. They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, realizing they\\'re both created the same exterior for themselves. Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor. He looks up at her house. PATRICK (continuing) So what \\' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass? KAT He just wants me to be someone I\\'m not. PATRICK Who? KAT BIANCA PATRICK No offense, but you\\'re sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but ... Kat stares at him with new admiration. KAT You know -- you\\'re not as vile as I thought you were. She leans drunkenly toward him. Their faces grow closer as if they\\'re about to kiss And then Patrick turns away PATRICK So, I\\'ll see you in school Kat stares at him, pissed. Then gets out of the car, SLAMMING the door shut behind her. CAMERON\\'S CAR - NIGHT Bianca and Cameron ride in silence. He finally breaks it. CAMERON I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be \"occupied\". BIANCA (faux-innocence ) I was? CAMERON You never wanted to go out with \\'me, did you? Bianca bites her lip. BIANCA (reluctant) Well, no... CAMERON Then that\\'s all you had to say. BIANCA But CAMERON You always been this selfish? BIANCA thinks a minute He pulls up in front of the house CAMERON Just because you\\'re beautiful, doesn\\'t mean you can treat people like they don\\'t matter. She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and gives him a kiss on the lips. He draws back in surprise, then kisses her back. She smiles, then gets out of the car without another word. Cameron grins and drives away CAMERON (continuing) And I\\'m back in the saddle. INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the others enter.

He sits next to Derek CLEM (continuing) Okay, now tell me again why he didn\\'t shoot the deputy? DEREK Because the deputy meant him no harm, my friend. It was only the sheriff that was the oppressor. Joey saunters in and takes his seat. JOEY Kat, babe, you were on fire. Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk MRS. BLAISE Well now, did everyone have a good weekend? JOEY Maybe we should ask Verona Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk. Kat looks up, down and around, everywhere but at Patrick. Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she\\'s supposed to talk about. MRS. BLAISE Okay then. Well. (beat) Oh, yes She clears her throat. MRS. BLAISE (continuing) I\\'d like you all to write your own version of Shakespeare\\'s Sonnet #141. Groans. MRS. BLAISE (continuing) Any form you\\'d like. Rhyme, no rhyme, whatever. I\\'d like to see you elaborate on his theme, however. Let\\'s read it aloud, shall we? Anyone? The class is frozen in apathy. MRS. BLAISE (continuing) Derek? Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Then grins. DEREK (reading; in his Rasta stoner drawl) In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors note/ But \\'tis my heart that loves what they despise/ Who in despite of view is pleas \\'d to dote. In the back of the room Clem raises his hand CLEM Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom pass? Damn if Shakespeare don\\'t act as a laxative on my person. INT. KENNY\\'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY Kat and Mandella scrape the peanuts out of their sauce. MANDELLA You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.

I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun. Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order. He sees Kat and smiles. PATRICK Hey She gathers her things and bolts out the door. Patrick looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat. INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY Cameron and Michael flank Patrick at his lab table MICHAEL So you got cozy with she who stings? PATRICK No - I\\'ve got a sweet-payin\\' job that I\\'m about to lose. CAMERON What\\'d you do to her? PATRICK I don \\' t know. (beat) I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it. Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then turn back to Patrick. CAMERON You realize this puts the whole operation in peril. PATRICK No shit. She won\\'t even look at me CAMERON Why can\\'t you just tell her you\\'re sorry? Patrick\\'s expression says that this is not a possibility. Michael makes a time out sign with his hands. MICHAEL I\\'m on it INT. HALLWAY - DAY Mandella is at her locker. Drawings of William Shakespeare adorn the door. She looks at them with a sigh, then ties her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut off her air supply. Michael walks up. MICHAEL Hey there. Tired of breathing? MANDELLA (shyly, as she loosens the scarf) Hi. MICHAEL Cool pictures. You a fan? MANDELLA Yeah. I guess. MICHAEL rocks. Very hip. MANDELLA You think? MICHAEL Oh yeah. She looks at him suspiciously MANDELLA Who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart, courage to make \\' B love known? Michael thinks for a minute.

PATRICK Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist. KAT Don\\'t for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties. PATRICK So what did I have an effect on ?

I\\'m takin\\' her with me INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz Patrick\\'s seat is conspicuously empty. From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED. The song grows louder until we realize it\\'s The Partridge Family\\'s \"I Think I Love You\". Being sung by Patrick. PATRICK (0. S.) \"This morning, I woke up with this feeling, I didn\\'t know how to deal with, and so I just decided to myself--\" The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands beneath the window, crooning. Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and doing backup vocal s. PATRICK \"I\\'d hide it to myself. And never talk about it. And didn\\'t I go and shout it when you walked into the room --\" He makes quite a sarcastic show of it. IN THE CLASSROOM Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her. Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below. OUTSIDE Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big finale. PATRICK (continuing) \" I think I love you I \" INSIDE The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, mortified, but with a slight smile INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling over their misfortune. MISCREANT Nice song, Verona. PATRICK Flog me. He makes the appropriate hand gesture Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine KAT (0. S.) Excuse me, Mr. Chapin? Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat standing in the doorway. She gives him a smile and he perks up a little. Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He turns fully to face her. KAT Sir, I\\'d like to state for the record that Mr. Verona \\' s current incarceration is unnecessary. I never filed a complaint. MR. CHAPIN You didn\\'t have to. He disrupted a classroom. Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the window. Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she \\' s talking about. She motions again, and looks toward the window with an expression that says, \"Make a break for it, moron.\" Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick inches out of his seat toward the window. The other miscreants watch with glee. KAT But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention. There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis. Patrick is halfway out the window now. And none too happy about it, considering they\\'re on the second floor. He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN. He starts to turn away from Kat MR. CHAPIN You\\'re not gonna change my mind, Kat. Rules stick. Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for the tree. KAT Wait, Mr. Chapin. There\\'s something I\\'ve always wanted to show you. He turns back toward her again, the very second before he would have spotted Patrick. Kat glances toward the window. Patrick\\'s just about to make the jump. MR. CHAPIN What? KAT These. From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump. The miscreants cheer, for both the daring\\' escape and the flash of skin. Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern. MR. CHAPIN I\\'m going to let that slide, Katarina. But if I catch you doing that again, you\\'ll be in here with the rest of these guys. He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without noticing Patrick\\'s absence. Kat smiles at him. KAT Thank you, Mr. Chapin. Kat bolts out the door. Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle mag, wiping the sweat from his brow. EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing no one. KAT He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me. PATRICK (0. S.) Look up, sunshine She does. He\\'s still in the tree PATRICK I guess I never told you I\\'m afraid of heights. KAT (smiling) C\\'mon. It\\'s not that bad PATRICK Try lookin\\' at it from this angle She assesses the branch structure KAT Put your right foot there -- PATRICK Forget it. I\\'m stayin\\'. KAT You want me to climb up and show you how to get down? PATRICK (voice trembling) Maybe. She sighs and dose so. When she gets to his level, she perches on the branch next to him. He grins at her. Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she\\'s been duped. KAT You shit! She climbs down after him EXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games KAT The Partridge Family? PATRICK I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off. KAT Good call. PATRICK So how\\'d you get Chapin to look the other way? KAT I dazzled him with my wit She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at giggling hyenas and wails on it. The barker hands her a stuffed animal as her prize. She hands it to the small KID next to her and they continue walking. PATRICK (sarcastic) A soft side? Who knew? KAT Yeah, well, don\\'t let it get out PATRICK So what\\'s your excuse? KAT Acting the way we do. PATRICK Yes KAT I don\\'t like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change. PATRICK So if you disappoint them from the start, you\\'re covered? KAT Something like that PATRICK Then you screwed up KAT How? PATRICK You never disappointed me. She blushes under his gaze PATRICK (continuing) You up for it? KAT For. . . ? He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins SERIES OF SHOTS: The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, stealthy and full of the desire to best the other. Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue. Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of her face. Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more shots, they\\'re both covered in paint She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is empty. KAT (continuing) Damn it! Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle. They land, laughing. It\\'s hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to find each other\\'s eyes. He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips, as he goes to kiss her. NEARBY The kid with the stuffed animal, points KID Look, Mom His mother hurries him away. What\\'s started as a tackle has turned into a passionate kiss EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT Patrick pulls up in Kat\\'s driveway. Their paint wardrobe has dried by now and they look like refugees from some strange, yet colorful, war. KAT State trooper? PATRICK Fallacy. KAT The duck? PATRICK Hearsay.

KAT No -- something real. Something no one else knows. PATRICK (in-between kisses) You\\'re sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me. KAT What? PATRICK No one else knows KAT You\\'re amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that? PATRICK Go to the prom with me Kat\\'s smile disappears. KAT Is that a request or a command? PATRICK You know what I mean KAT No. PATRICK No what? KAT No, I won\\'t go with you PATRICK Why not? KAT Because I don\\'t want to. It\\'s a stupid tradition. Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can\\'t very well tell her he being paid to take her. PATRICK People won\\'t expect you to go... Kat turns to him, getting angry. KAT Why are you doing this? KAT All of it -- what\\'s in it for you? He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her suspicions. KAT (continuing) Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What? PATRICK So I have to have a motive to be with you? KAT You tell me. PATRICK You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that? KAT (quietly) Answer the question, Patrick PATRICK (angry) Nothing! There\\'s nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company. He takes out a cigarette. She breaks it in half before she SLAMS the car door and walks into the house. Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front door and watches him go EXT. STREET - NIGHT Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who has decided that he doesn\\'t need to wear pants.

He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and smacks his hand away. CAMERON (continuing) I figured you\\'d get to the good stuff eventually. BIANCA What good stuff? CAMERON The \"real you\". BIANCA Like my fear of wearing pastels? He looks stricken. BIANCA (continuing) I\\'m kidding. (beat) You know how sometimes you just become this \"persona\"? And you don\\'t know how to quit? CAMERON (matter of fact) No BIANCA Okay -- you\\'re gonna need to learn how to lie. INT. HALLWAY - DAY Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker. Finally, it opens.

LOVE, WILLIAM S.\" Mandella\\'s agog. Trevor walks by and sees her holding the dress. TREVOR You\\'re gonna look splendiferous in that, Mandella. Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.

He zeroes in on Cameron, now consoling a pissed-off Bianca. Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the evil about to erupt. PATRICK My grandmother\\'s . KAT What? PATRICK That\\'s where I was last year. She\\'d never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her. I wasn\\'t in jail, I don\\'t know Marilyn Manson, and I\\'ve never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story. He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes. Kat stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh KAT That \\' s completely adorable! PATRICK It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook? He\\'s interrupted by Joey\\'s hand on his shoulder. JOEY What\\'s Bianca doing here with that cheese dick? I didn\\'t pay you to let some little punk ass snake me. ACROSS THE ROOM Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to Cameron and Bianca. MICHAEL (to Cameron) Feces hitting fan. C\\'mon Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca staring after them. ACROSS THE ROOM Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this situation. MICHAEL (continuing) Joey, pal, compadre. Let\\'s take it easy. Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron. JOEY You two are in big trouble Cameron faces Joey. CAMERON Admit it. You lost. Be a man. Joey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White Rastas. DEREK Very uncool, my brother JOEY I\\'m not your brother, white boy. The other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that they\\'re white. Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat. JOEY (continuing) Just so you know -- she\\'ll only spread her legs once. Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she\\'s hearing. Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back. It\\'s Bianca. And she BELTS the hell out of him BIANCA That\\'s for making my date bleed She BELTS him again BIANCA (continuing) That\\'s for my sister. And AGAIN BIANCA (continuing) And that\\'s for me. Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly. COWBOY And that\\'s for the fourth grade, asshole.

PATRICK It wasn\\'t like that. KAT Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me? PATRICK I didn\\'t care about the money. He catches up to her now PATRICK (continuing) I cared about -- She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than in anger. KAT You are so not what I thought you were. He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up. After a second, she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight. Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching. She\\'s never looked more guilty. INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a blanket, watching \"Sixteen Candles\". When Molly Ringwald leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an infomercial The phone sits next to her. Not ringing. Bianca breezes in, bearing a cup of tea. BIANCA Are you sure you don\\'t want to come with us? It\\'ll be fun. Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile. KAT I \\' m sure . Bianca sits down next to her BIANCA You looked beautiful last night, you know. KAT So did you Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron. He peeks his head inside. CAMERON She okay? BIANCA I hope so. The door shuts behind her as Walter enters. WALTER Was that your sister? KAT Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm. WALTER Funny. Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the infomercial with Kat. WALTER (continuing) I don\\'t understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to? KAT No, Daddy. WALTER (dreading the answer) So tell me about this dance. Was it fun? KAT Parts of it. WALTER Which parts? KAT The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy. WALTER Bianca did what? KAT What\\'s the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her? WALTER No -- impressed. Kat looks up in surprise. WALTER (continuing) You know, fathers don\\'t like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we\\'ve become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You\\'ve had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won\\'t even be able to watch the game. KAT (hopeful) When I go? WALTER Oh, Christ. Don\\'t tell me you\\'ve changed your mind. I already sent \\'em a check. Kat reaches over and gives him a hug INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes from the food line. CAMERON (0. S.) Katarina? She turns and looks at him CAMERON I\\'d like to express my apologies. KAT For what?

INT. HALLWAY - DAY Kat stomps up the hallway, full of menace CLASSROOM - DAY Bianca\\'s English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open book in hand. TEACHER Who can tell me at what point Lucentio admits his deception? The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward the hallway. KAT (to the teacher) Family emergency. HALLWAY - DAY Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair between two rows of lockers. BIANCA Let go! KAT You set me up. BIANCA I just wanted -- KAT What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What? BIANCA No! I just wanted Miss Perky walks up MISS PERKY Ladies? Shall we take a trip to my office? INT. MISS PERKY\\'S OFFICE - DAY Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her, then focuses on Bianca. MISS PERKY So you\\'re the real bitch BIANCA Yes! Okay? Yes -- I\\'m the real bitch. I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I could. Apparently, this makes me a horrible person. I\\'m sorry. She turns to Kat. BIANCA (continuing) I swear -- I didn\\'t know about the money. I didn\\'t even know Joey was involved. I would never intentionally hurt you, Kat. MISS PERKY (to Kat) Do you care to respond? KAT Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it? MISS PERKY Just smack her now. Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm. BIANCA (to Miss Perky) We\\'ll be getting back to you. MISS PERKY What, no hug?

BLAISE (continuing) Would anyone care to read theirs aloud? No one moves. Then Kat slowly stands up. KAT I\\'11 go Patrick looks up. MRS. BLAISE Oh, Lord. She downs a couple Prozac MRS. BLAISE (continuing) Please proceed. Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath before reading from her notebook. KAT I hate the way you talk to me/ and the way you cut your hair/ I hate the way you drive my car/ I hate it when you stare. She pauses, then continues KAT (continuing) I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and the way you read my mind/ I hate you so much it makes me sick/ it even makes me rhyme. She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who stares at the floor. KAT (continuing) I hate the way you\\'re always right/ I hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you make me laugh/ even worse when you make me cry/ I hate it that you\\'re not around/ and the fact that you didn\\'t call/ But mostly I hate the way I don \\' t hate you/ not even close, not even a little bit, not even any at all. She looks directly at Patrick. He looks back this time. The look they exchange says everything. Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains in stunned silence. EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she\\'s greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the front seat. She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins around. Patrick stands there, smiling. KAT A Fender Strat. You bought this? PATRICK I thought you could use it. When you start your band. She doesn\\'t answer, but hides a smile, so he walks closer. PATRICK (continuing) Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl. KAT Is that right? PATRICK Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her. Blushes and looks down. PATRICK (continuing) You know -- it\\'s not every day you find a girl who\\'ll flash her tits to get you out of detention. Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does She lets him this time. Then breaks it off KAT You can\\'t just buy me a guitar every time you screw up, you know. He grimaces. PATRICK I know He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again. KAT And don\\'t just think you can He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time. STRATFORD HOUSE - SUNSET We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER. STRATFORD HOUSE/BACKYARD - SUNSET Patrick is at the barbecue grill, flipping burgers. Kat watches. KAT Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill? PATRICK Because I like to torture you. KAT Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook? PATRICK Don \\' t you even dare. . . ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio. CAMERON They do to! BIANCA They do not! Rises to get the yearbook. CAMERON Can someone please tell her that sunflower seeds come from sunflowers? ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA Severely making-out in a lawn chair. She comes up for a breath. MANDELLA I can\\'t remember a word of Shakespeare right now. Isn\\'t that weird? Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND PATRICK She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca now hands her. KAT You\\'re freaked over this, aren\\'t you? Bianca hands her the yearbook BIANCA He\\'s more than freaked. He\\'s froke Flips to a page. KAT I\\'d like to call your attention to Patrick Verona\\'s stunning bad-ass look of 1995 --- INSERT - A horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses, bad hair, headgear -- the works. She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes and throws a handful of pretzels at her. BIANCA Patrick -- is that- a. KAT Perm? PATRICK Ask my attorney. Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling -- as we CRANE UP and hear a GIRLY PUNK version of The Partridge Family\\'s \"I Think I Love You\". FADE OUT: END '"

attention back to mr chapin while patrick inches out of his seat toward the window the other miscreants watch with glee kat but mr chapin i hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention
